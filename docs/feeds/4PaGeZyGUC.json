Humanity is facing serious disputes over our most important resource. What impact is our lifestyle having on our planet's water cycles?\n\nAlong six rivers on four continents, the documentary explores the question of why this vital resource, water, is becoming increasingly scarce - and who‚Äôs responsible. 70 per cent of fresh water is used in agriculture. And a large proportion of this goes into the production of animal feed. Our excessive meat consumption is partly to blame for the fact that mighty rivers such as the Spanish Ebro or the Colorado in the USA and Mexico are drying up. Factory farming businesses are worth billions to major agricultural companies, but this overuse of water often goes hand in hand with its pollution. Europe has outsourced its dirtiest industries to countries such as India. Around 20 per cent of global water pollution is caused by the textile industry. The film provides rare insights into Indian factories and life in the places where contaminants are discharged.\n\nBut it‚Äôs not all bad news. In the film, we also meet people who‚Äôve come up with solutions. In France, dams are dismantled to revitalize rivers; in an Egyptian oasis the inhabitants experiment with hydroponics; and in India, an individual known as the \"water man‚Äù uses a millennia-old technique to coax rivers from deserts that dried up decades ago.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

They are one of the most expressive and productive languages yet remain relatively unknown.T hey are still used heavily in financial markets globally. Array developers made the first wide spread use of learning by katas and patterns, then called idioms, and including the now pervasive map reduce. The dynamic Array languages originated with APL followed by APL2, NIAL, J and k.\n\nOften considered high barrier languages, we argue that they are much like a challenging instrument that when mastered allow to make amazing music with seeming little effort. We will also discuss why Vector programming is a natural low impedance approach for dealing with today‚Äôs high performance NoSQL and NewSQL column stores.\n\nIn the late 60s and early 70s Fortran, Lisp, COBOL, APL and Basic were the hot languages. Lisp, APL and later Basic pioneered the ‚Äúthe repl‚Äù of interactive computing. APL provides an efficient array/vector language for numeric computing. and found wide acceptance in financial, engineering and statistical computing. APL inspired ‚Äì the Smalltalk environment; array extensions in other general languages such as Python NumPy and NamedTuple; F-Script for IOS Cocoa; special purpose languages such as MatLab and R; to recent proposed extensions for value types in Java; along with special purpose vector hardware like GPUs and recent Intel AVX instructions.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nKevlin Henney ‚Ä¢ 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/2Yahf9U\nHenney &amp; Monson-Haefel ‚Ä¢ 97 Things Every Software Architect Should Know ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3pZuHsQ\nMatthew Skelton &amp; Manuel Pais ‚Ä¢ Team Topologies ‚Ä¢ http://amzn.to/3sVLyLQ\nMichael Jackson ‚Ä¢ Software Requirements and Specifications ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3ql2T14\nGeoffrey West ‚Ä¢ Scale ‚Ä¢ http://amzn.to/3eKMbpc\nDonald G.

When are these advantages likely (and unlikely) to translate to other businesses? And how can a business responsibly evaluate if the same advantages are available in their particular case?

The story begins a few weeks after the death of Jina Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish student who died on 16 September 2022.\n\nShe had allowed a few strands of hair to escape from her veil. Members of the Iranian morality police beat her so severely that she died of her injuries. The regime in Tehran has denied all responsibility for her death, which triggered nationwide mass protests under a slogan that echoed all around the world: \"Woman, Life, Freedom‚Äù.\n\nIranian filmmaker Shorresh Afkari filmed in secret, smuggling the footage out of the country to a colleague in France. His documentary gives a voice to people who, like large sections of the Iranian population, have run out of strength and patience.\n\nFor example, the film observes a young couple who dream of being able to express their love openly and in complete freedom. We also meet a taxi driver, who ends up in prison as a bitter opponent of the regime. His mother tries to protect him at all costs. A painter continues to practise her art despite censorship; a doctor secretly treats demonstrators. A young man is prepared to do anything for cash, even sell one of his kidneys. Just like men who dare to protest, women who show their hair in public and publicly oppose the regime still face harsh punishment, including the death penalty. For this reason, many interviewees speak off-camera to protect their anonymity.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #iran \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

But a new conflict, was about to begin.  \nThe following day, US President Bush made a statement to the people of Iraq. \"In my view‚Ä¶ the Iraqi people should put Saddam aside‚Äù. At the very  same time, Shia in the south and Kurds in the north took control of much of the country. Saddam‚Äôs regime was on the ropes. But the uprisings would end in disaster. \n\nIn this final episode of our Gulf War series, we‚Äôll explore the aftermath of the war. Why did the uprisings fail? Why didn‚Äôt the Coalition intervene? And how did the Gulf War set the stage for the 2003 invasion of Iraq? \n\nExplore and licence the film clips used in this video from IWM Film: \nhttps://film.iwmcollections.org.uk/collections/_DEbW5lOw\n\nFollow IWM on social media:\nhttps://twitter.com/I_W_M\nhttps://www.instagram.com/imperialwarmuseums\nhttps://www.facebook.com/iwm.london\n\n#war  #history  #desertstorm\n\nIraqi GDP Data: Foote, Christopher &amp; Crane, Keith &amp; Block, William &amp; Gray, Simon.

While social media has helped tourism boom and brought prosperity to the region, it also poses a threat to the landscape and its unique historical heritage.\n\nCappadocia draws more than four million tourists every year. The region in Turkey is famous for its extraordinary \"fairy chimneys\" - carved-out boulders, some of which are still inhabited. This wonderland became a UNESCO World Heritage Site decades ago.\nEvery day, hot air balloons carrying tourists drift across valleys dotted with \"fairy chimneys.\" The rock formations, the hot air balloons, the sunrise - the setting couldn't be more instagrammable.\nMustafa K√∂se knows exactly how to get the perfect shot that tourists want for their social media posts. \"Cultural tourism is dead,\" the photographer says - all people want now is something to show off with on Instagram. It's a development he struggles with, even though he makes a decent living giving the tourists what they want. \nZehra Demircan took over her father's \"cave hotel\" a couple of years ago. He did his best to preserve the family's \"fairy chimneys\" in their original state so that the accommodation still provides an authentic glimpse of Cappadocia. Zehra Demircan is following suit, modernizing the hotel as carefully as possible. Like Mustafa K√∂se, she sometimes feels conflicted about her visitors. \"We had a group here who didn't visit anything for the entire week,\" she says. \"The whole time, they just took photos for social media.\"\nLocal activist M√ºkremin Tokmak has been fighting for years against the destruction of this unique landscape. He was appalled by the construction of a highway cutting through the historical region, paving the way for even more tourism. He documents the effects of the construction work on the valleys and the old churches that stood here. He hasn't given up hope that tourism can be held in check. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #cappadocia #instagram #turkey \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.
