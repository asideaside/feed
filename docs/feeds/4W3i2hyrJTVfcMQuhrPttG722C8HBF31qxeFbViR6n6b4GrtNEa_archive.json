One day, she picked up a strange book and then started to gain the power of controlling tentacles. To her, tentacles are just a part in her ordinary life; it has never been a big deal for her. However, her girly mind does want to get them dressed up and stay pretty.<p>\nAfter gaining power, she started hearing Ancient Whispers and Revelations. Hence, she began her VTuber activities to deliver random sanity checks on humanity, as an ordinary girl.</p></p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://hololive.hololivepro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Dodgers_2025_008.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://hololive.hololivepro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Dodgers_2025_008.jpg 400w, https://hololive.hololivepro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Dodgers_2025_008-240x240.jpg 240w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\">\nA Nephilim who was once the embodiment of hope back in “The Paradise”.<p>\nWhile she has left to set off on an adventure, she continues to deliver hope through her lyrics and songs, with determination in her voice.</p>\nShe also bears the precarious and unstable dual nature of a half-demon and half-angel; this phenomenon can be observed on rare occasions, in the form of the most unpredictably<p>\nyaba—*ahem*, “surprising”, comments from IRyS herself.
