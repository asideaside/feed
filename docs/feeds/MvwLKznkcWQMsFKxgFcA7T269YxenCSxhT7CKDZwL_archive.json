This boost is a testament to the company’s growing fan engagement and its ability to monetize its diverse offerings.</li><li>ANYCOLOR operates several core business segments:\n<ul><li> This segment saw steady growth.

This is especially true as the digital entertainment landscape continues to evolve.</p><h2>Livestreaming: The Heartbeat of the VTuber World</h2><p>For many fans, the magic of VTubers comes alive during live streaming sessions. ANYCOLOR’s livestreaming segment remains a key pillar of its business model. Here’s why:</p><ul><li><strong>Steady and Reliable Revenue:</strong>Livestreaming uses a membership-driven model. Fans subscribe to get exclusive content, perks, and closer interaction with their favorite VTubers. In Q3, livestreaming revenue reached 1,301 million JPY—a modest but steady increase from the previous year.</li><li>Live streams are more than just a revenue stream—they’re a way for fans to build community. Livestreaming offers interactivity and real-time connection. These aspects help solidify fan loyalty. As a result, other revenue streams like merchandise sales and event participation are driven.</li><li><strong>Ad Revenue and Sponsorships:</strong>Beyond memberships, livestreaming brings in ad revenue and sponsorship deals. ANYCOLOR’s ability to maintain a strong viewer base ensures that these revenue streams remain healthy.</li></ul><p>Overall, livestreaming is the heartbeat of ANYCOLOR’s VTuber ecosystem, providing both financial stability and a vibrant platform for fan interaction.</p><p>ANYCOLOR’s commerce segment is where the company is truly breaking new ground. The revenue reached 7,204 million JPY in Q3. This is a staggering increase compared to previous periods. This segment is driving much of the overall growth. Let’s dive into what’s behind this success:</p><ul><li><strong>Record Sales and Order Backlog:</strong>The report highlights that commerce revenue reached its highest-ever quarterly level. Large-scale initiatives and innovative marketing strategies led to sales figures that far exceeded targets. Fans have been enthusiastic about purchasing exclusive merchandise and digital content, resulting in a significant order backlog. This backlog even points to the fact that fans are eagerly waiting for new products and initiatives.</li><li><strong>Overcoming Operational Challenges:</strong>Previous quarters had been hampered by shipping delays, which negatively affected sales. However, in Q3, ANYCOLOR managed to clear these issues, ensuring that products reached fans in a timely manner. This operational improvement has been a major contributor to the record performance.</li><li>The shift towards online commerce isn’t just about selling products—it’s about creating an engaging, seamless experience for fans. ANYCOLOR has invested in digital tools. They use e-commerce platforms that make it easier for fans to access exclusive content. They also help to access merchandise. This digital-first approach is crucial in today’s market, where convenience and speed are paramount.</li><li><strong>Impact on the Fan Community:</strong>For fans, buying merchandise is a way to show support. It also helps them connect with their favorite VTubers. The strong performance in commerce reflects not only effective sales strategies but also the deep engagement of ANYCOLOR’s fan base. Fans are willing to invest in the brand, whether it’s limited-edition items or exclusive digital content. That commitment is translating into impressive revenue figures.</li></ul><h2>Event Success: Record-Breaking Milestones</h2><p>Live events have always been a cornerstone of the VTuber experience. In Q3, ANYCOLOR’s event segment showed extraordinary growth:</p><ul><li><strong>Massive Revenue Increase:</strong>Event revenue climbed to 1,428 million JPY. This is almost double compared to the previous year. ANYCOLOR’s live events are clearly resonating with fans. High-profile events such as music festivals and countdown shows have exceeded expectations, both in terms of attendance and sales.</li><li><strong>Fan Excitement and Community Building:</strong>Events create a unique atmosphere that blends live performance with digital interaction. They create a connection between the virtual and the real. Fans can experience the charisma and energy of their favorite VTubers in person or through high-quality digital streams. This immersive experience drives both ticket sales and ancillary revenues, such as exclusive event merchandise.</li><li>The report notes that Q3 events were successful. This success occurred despite some cancellations and postponements earlier in the fiscal year. These events not only recovered lost ground, but also set new records. This demonstrates ANYCOLOR’s ability to adapt, plan, and execute large-scale events that meet—and even exceed—fan expectations.</li><li>The Q4 outlook is equally promising, with planned events that are expected to generate even higher revenue. ANYCOLOR plans to continue its winning streak in live event production. They are implementing initiatives like “NIJISANJI FES 2025”. They are also collaborating with major venues like Tokyo Dome City.</li></ul><p>Promotion plays a crucial role in ANYCOLOR’s integrated strategy. Although the promotional segment saw a modest revenue increase in Q3 (1,618 million JPY), its importance should not be underestimated:</p><ul><li>Promotion is all about maintaining the brand’s presence and engaging with fans across multiple platforms. ANYCOLOR has successfully aligned its promotional activities with broader market trends. This alignment ensures that its VTubers remain relevant and visible.</li><li><strong>Supporting Other Segments:</strong>Effective promotion not only boosts direct revenue through sponsorships and ad deals. It also drives traffic to livestreams, commerce sites, and live events. In this way, promotional efforts serve as a critical support system for the entire business ecosystem.</li><li><strong>Strategic Resource Allocation:</strong>The report indicates that some VTuber resources were shifted to support major events. Despite this, the promotional segment has performed consistently. Maintaining this balance ensures immediate revenue spikes from some initiatives. Meanwhile, the overall brand remains strong and continually attracts new fans.</li></ul><h2>A Critical Look at Nijisanji English (NijiEN)</h2><p>While ANYCOLOR’s domestic operations continue to thrive, the international arm—Nijisanji English (NijiEN)—is showing signs of strain. NijiEN faces several challenges. These could affect its long-term prospects, unlike the robust performance of its Japanese counterpart.</p><p>The data suggests that NijiEN’s revenue has been on a downward trajectory. The international segment is an essential part of ANYCOLOR’s global strategy. However, it has not achieved the same financial momentum as the domestic division. The report indicates that NijiEN’s revenue, which once showed promise, is now experiencing a decline compared to previous quarters. This downturn is a significant concern. This is especially true because the international market is expected to be a major growth driver for the VTuber industry.</p><h3>The Vanishing Live Events</h3><p>One of the most glaring differences between NijiEN and its domestic counterpart is the lack of live events. The domestic group has continued to generate substantial revenue from live events. These include record-breaking shows and festivals. However, NijiEN has not maintained a consistent event schedule. In recent quarters, NijiEN has seen little to no investment in live events. This absence is critical. Live events are not only a major revenue source. They are also a key way to engage and expand the fan community. The lack of high-profile events is adding to NijiEN’s struggles. It may be a missed opportunity to tap into international enthusiasm for immersive experiences.</p><h3>Dwindling Viewership and Engagement</h3><p>Another red flag for NijiEN is the noticeable decline in viewership numbers. In a space where active and engaged audiences are the lifeblood of success, dwindling viewership can have a severe impact. It creates a cascading effect on revenue streams. This ranges from livestreaming subscriptions to digital merchandise sales. Critics and industry insiders have noted that NijiEN’s viewership metrics have been slipping. </p><h3>Strategic Implications and the Need for a Course Correction</h3><p>The challenges faced by Nijisanji English raise important questions about its current strategy. As ANYCOLOR continues to invest heavily in domestic operations with strong returns, NijiEN’s performance appears to lag behind. Relying solely on digital revenue streams may not be sufficient to sustain growth. Live events provide an energizing boost that is needed in a competitive international market.</p><p>For NijiEN to turn the tide, a re-evaluation of its approach is necessary. This might include:</p><ul><li><strong>Revamping Content Strategy:</strong> Developing fresh, engaging content that resonates with international audiences and combats the stagnation in viewership.</li><li><strong>Reintroducing Live Events:</strong> Investing in live or hybrid digital-physical events could reinvigorate the fan community. These events could drive up engagement and open up new revenue opportunities.</li><li><strong>Enhanced Marketing Efforts:</strong> Strengthening promotional campaigns targeted at global markets may help recapture lost viewers. These campaigns can also drive renewed interest in NijiEN’s offerings.</li></ul><p>Nijisanji English holds tremendous potential due to its international appeal. However, these current challenges suggest that ANYCOLOR needs to act swiftly. Failing to address declining revenue and engagement could undermine the segment’s long-term viability. It would also impact its role in ANYCOLOR’s global expansion strategy.</p><h2>The Future of their VTubers: ANYCOLOR’s Strategic Vision</h2><p>ANYCOLOR’s FY2025 Q3 report isn’t just a snapshot of current performance—it’s a roadmap for their future. Here are some key strategic insights:</p><ul><li><strong>Ambitious Growth Targets:</strong>ANYCOLOR aims to increase its sales by 88% and operating profit by 94% by FY2027.

ANYCOLOR’s report also outlines some risks and the strategies in place to address them:</p><ul><li>While previous quarters saw issues such as shipping delays, ANYCOLOR has implemented measures to ensure smoother operations. The record commerce numbers in Q3 indicate that these challenges are being overcome effectively.</li><li><strong>Talent and Human Resources:</strong>In a highly competitive industry, attracting and retaining top talent is crucial.
