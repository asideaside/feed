For the past 6 months I've been working on an open source python library that implements differentiable geometric optics in PyTorch. It's very experimental still, but eventually the goal is to use it to design optical systems with a state of the art optimization framework and a beautiful code based API. Think OpenSCAD, but for optical systems.</p><p>Not only is PyTorch's autograd an amazing general purpose optimizer, but torch.nn (the neural network building blocks) can be used pretty much out of the box to model an optical system. This is because there is a strong analogy to be made between layers of a neural network, and optical elements in a so-called sequential optical system. So the magic is that we can stack lenses as if we were stacking Conv2D and ReLu layers and everything works out. Instead of Conv2D you have ray-surface collision detection, instead of ReLu you have the law of refraction. Designing lenses is surprisingly like training a neural network.</p><p>You should be able to `pip install torchlensmaker` to try it out, but I just set it up so let me know if there's any trouble.</p><p>I was part of the Winter 1'24 batch at the Recurse Center (<a href=\"https://www.recurse.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.recurse.com/</a>) working on this project pretty much full time.

I’m Tony, co-founder of Inngest. I wanted to share AgentKit, our Typescript multi-agent library we’ve been cooking and testing with some early users in prod for months.</p><p>Although  OpenAI’s Agents SDK has been launched since, we think an Agent framework should offer more deterministic and flexible routing, work with multiple model providers, embrace MCP (for rich tooling), and support the unstoppable and growing community of TypeScript AI developers by enabling a smooth transition to production use cases.</p><p>This is why we are building AgentKit, and we’re really excited about it for a few reasons:</p><p>Firstly, it’s simple. We embrace KISS principles brought by Anthropic and HuggingFace by allowing you to gradually add autonomy to your AgentKit program using primitives:</p><p>- Agents: LLM calls that can be combined with prompts, tools, and MCP native support.</p><p>- Networks: a simple way to get Agents to collaborate with a shared State, including handoff.</p><p>- State: combines conversation history with a fully typed state machine, used in routing.</p><p>- Routers: where the autonomy lives, from code-based to LLM-based (ex: ReAct) orchestration</p><p>The routers are where the magic happens, and allow you to build deterministic, reliable, testable agents.</p><p>AgentKit routing works as follows: the network calls itself in a loop, inspecting the State to determine which agents to call next using a router.  The returned agent runs, then optionally updates state data using its tools.  On the next loop, the network inspects state data and conversation history, and determines which new agent to run.</p><p>This fully typed state machine routing allows you to deterministically build agents using any of the effective agent patterns — which means your code is easy to read, edit, understand, and debug.</p><p>This also makes handoff incredibly easy: you define when agents should hand off to each other using regular code and state (or by calling an LLM in the router for AI-based routing). This is similar to the OpenAI Agents SDK but easier to manage, plan, and build.</p><p>Then comes the local development and moving to production capabilities.</p><p>AgentKit is compatible with Inngest’s tooling, meaning that you can test agents using Inngest’s local DevServer, which provides traces, inputs, outputs, replay, tool, and MCP inputs and outputs, and (soon) a step-over debugger so that you can easily understand and visually see what's happening in the agent loop.</p><p>In production, you can also optionally combine AgentKit with Inngest for fault-tolerant execution.  Each agent’s LLM call is wrapped in a step, and tools can use multiple steps to incorporate things like human-in-the-loop.  This gives you native orchestration, observability, and out-of-the-box scale.</p><p>You will find the documentation as an example of an AgentKit SWE-bench and multiple Coding Agent examples.</p><p>It’s fully open-source under the Apache 2 license.</p><p>If you want to get started:</p><p>- npm: npm i @inngest/agent-kit</p><p>We’re excited to finally launch AgentKit; let us know what you think!</p>","contentLength":3023,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43426164"},{"title":"Show HN: Hyperbrowser MCP Server – Connect AI agents to the web through browsers","url":"https://github.com/hyperbrowserai/mcp","date":1742490072,"author":"shrisukhani","guid":157,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Hi HN! Excited to share our MCP Server at Hyperbrowser - something we’ve been working on for a few days. We think it’s a pretty neat way to connect LLMs and IDEs like Cursor / Windsurf to the internet.</p><p>Our MCP server exposes seven tools for data collection and browsing:</p><p>1. `scrape_webpage` - Extract formatted (markdown, screenshot etc) content from any webpage</p><p>2. `crawl_webpages` - Navigate through multiple linked pages and extract LLM-friendly formatted content</p><p>3. `extract_structured_data` - Convert messy HTML into structured JSON</p><p>4. `search_with_bing` - Query the web and get results with Bing search</p><p>5. `browser_use_agent` - Fast, lightweight browser automation with the Browser Use agent</p><p>6. `openai_computer_use_agent` - General-purpose automation using OpenAI’s CUA model</p><p>7. `claude_computer_use_agent` - Complex browser tasks using Claude computer use</p><p>You can connect the server to Cursor, Windsurf, Claude desktop, and any other MCP clients with this command `npx -y hyperbrowser-mcp` and a Hyperbrowser API key. We're running this on our cloud browser infrastructure that we've been developing for the past few months – it handles captchas, proxies, and stealth browsing automatically.</p><p>Some fun things you can do with it: (1) deep research with claude desktop, (2) summarizing the latest HN posts, (3) creating full applications from short gists in Cursor, (3) automating code review in cursor, (4) generating llms.txt for any website with windsurf, (5) ordering sushi from windsurf (admittedly, this is just for fun - probably not actually going to do this myself).</p><p>We're building this server in the open and would love feedback from anyone building agents or working with web automation. If you find bugs or have feature requests, please let us know! One big issue with MCPs in general is that the installation UX sucks and auth credentials have to be hardcoded. We don’t have a solution to this right now but Anthropic seems to be working on something here so excited for that to come out.
