Policies can be written in any language that compiles to WASM, offering developers flexibility beyond traditional policy engines that require specific languages like Rego. Kubewarden policies are applied at admission control or runtime to ensure compliance and security. It is lightweight, fast, with a portable design, ensures minimal performance overhead and scalability in cloud-native environments.\n\nJoin CNCF Ambassador Carlos Santana as they explore its focus on extensibility, ease of use, and ecosystem compatibility, and how Kubewarden is ideal for organizations seeking fine-grained control over their Kubernetes clusters while simplifying policy authoring and enforcement.</article>","contentLength":878,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/46VGMAH_8jY?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null}],"tags":["dev","k8s"]}
