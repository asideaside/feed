It was a night to remember for both fans of hololive and the L.A. Dodgers!</p><p>The game started with YAGOO taking to the field to throw the first pitch. Mascot characters Subaru Duck and UDIN also made an appearance on the field, watching over YAGOO as he threw the ceremonial first pitch.</p><p>Soon after, Ninomae Ina’nis, IRyS, and Koseki Bijou greeted hololive production and Dodgers fans alike with the iconic phrase said before every Dodger game – “It’s time for Dodger baseball!”  And with that, the game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Houston Astros began!</p><p>As the match continued, exclusive hype videos from the three talents were broadcast to the stadium, encouraging fans to show their support for the Dodgers. At the 7th inning stretch, all three talents led the crowd in a passionate performance of  the classic baseball anthem “Take Me Out to the Ball Game”. The passion was certainly felt, as the crowd’s  cheers echoed throughout the stadium at the encouragement of Ninomae Ina’nis, IRyS, and Koseki Bijou.</p><p>But outside of the “in-game” entertainment, guests were able to indulge in a range of activities for a full ‘hololive’ experience. Attendees received special hololive night trading cards upon entry, this time featuring Ninomae Ina’nis, IRyS, and Koseki Bijou dressed for the occasion in their very own Los Angeles Dodgers uniforms. The line for attendees to get their hands on these exclusive trading cards stretched well into the parking lot, showing just how much enthusiasm there was for the return of this collaboration.</p><p>Located around the stadium were various photo spots for attendees to take pictures with the featured talents in the form of life-sized cutouts with themed backgrounds. Subaru Duck and UDIN also made a special appearance for photos. Fans in their commemorative jerseys, cosplays, and casual wear stood in line to take pictures with their favorite talent, memorializing  the moment in the form of a photograph.</p><p>There was no shortage of special merchandise to purchase! Commemorative towels, lanyards, stickers, T-Shirts, can cooler, and acrylic stands themed after the event were available to purchase at the stadium.

Throughout the night, surprise videos messages from hololive English -Myth-, hololive English -Promise-, hololive English -Advent-, and hololive English -Justice- kept the energy high with their cheer.</p><p>Towards the end of the event, highlight videos from previous hololive English concerts and concert events were shown, leading up to performances of songs like “Connect the World,” “Breaking Dimensions,” and “Our Bright Parade”.\nThe energy among the fans reached its peak as the event drew to a powerful and unforgettable climax.</p><p>The night ended in excitement, with fans of both the Los Angeles Dodgers and hololive experiencing the best of both worlds.</p><p>Date: July 5th, 2025 4:15 PM (PDT)\nVenue: Dodger Stadium (Los Angeles, CA)</p><p>\nNinomae Ina’nis / IRyS / Koseki Bijou</p><p>\n#hololiveDodgers</p>","contentLength":4982,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Check Out Kureiji Ollie’s Answers to Fan Questions from the holoplus AMA!","url":"https://hololivepro.com/news_en/20250731-02-8/","date":1753887643,"author":"narita","guid":625,"unread":true,"content":"<img width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://hololive.hololivepro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/250725_main.jpg\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://hololive.hololivepro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/250725_main.jpg 1920w, https://hololive.hololivepro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/250725_main-640x360.jpg 640w, https://hololive.hololivepro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/250725_main-1440x810.jpg 1440w, https://hololive.hololivepro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/250725_main-768x432.jpg 768w, https://hololive.hololivepro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/250725_main-1536x864.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><p>To celebrate Kureiji Ollie’s appointment as the new holoplus Official Ambassador, we hosted a special AMA (Ask Me Anything) event on holoplus on July 1st, where fans had the chance to send in their questions directly to Ollie!</p><p>In her signature energetic and chaotic style, Ollie took the time to answer many questions with plenty of charm, wit, and unexpected twists! Her responses are as wild and delightful as you’d expect… and definitely worth checking out!</p><p>If you missed the AMA, or just want to relive the fun, be sure to take a look at her answers below!</p><h3>Here are Kureiji Ollie’s Answers to Your Questions</h3><p>\nI think it was the first fes that I’ve participated in- I was proud of myself when I sang with Haachama-senpai! I still get compliments for that one performance, and I’ll use it as my biggest milestone ever!</p><p>\nBelieve it or not, there has never been a Halloween-themed collab before! I’m not only talking about the dead beings, but also the demons, succubuses talents we have in hololive! So I’d like to do a hololive Halloween special one day! 👀✨️</p><p>\nIt was during a viewer-participation among us stream, somebody suggested the name and I thought it’d be funny to name him Udin lololol Funfact tho! I was originally about to name him Josephine!👀</p><p>\nI don’t have much stories for FLOWGLOW but I did went on a date with Chihaya! 🎧🔧 She was the kouhai yet she was the one taking care of me when I was at Japan, she even gave me a brief explanation for Gundam! As for Justice, and I won’t stop talking about this, was when Gigi and Cecilia were in their own world eating strawberry daifuku 🍓🌷 (lowkey ship them)</p><p>\nI want to play more with the ReGLOSS members! I’ve only ever collabed with Ririka once, I want to collab with the other ReGLOSS members too!</p><p>\nBIG NO. LET ME BE THE ONLY ZOMBIE THANK YOU VERY MUCH 👁👁🧟‍♀️</p><p>\nThat we have an annual company party with every talent and every staff like in those idol animes- I’ve realized we don’t do that cause everyone is too busy 🥲</p><p>\nVery fun! I’ve never felt more alive! Even though I’m a zombie, hehe</p><p>\nMe but with big boobs.</p><p>\nI’m not that loud anymore, I speak English most of the time, and I’m not always horny I promise 🥹🥹</p><p>\nIf I don’t work then I can’t pay bills, as simple as that uwu</p><p>\nI usually just stop when it starts straining me~ Knowing when your streaming limit is very important! Better to rest for a day than be burnt out for a whole month 👍✨️</p><p>\nI feel like if I auditioned now then I wouldn’t be able to make it KSKSKSKKSK the level of entertainment needed to pass auditions is CRAZY (no pun intended) and I’ve always felt lucky that I managed to get in when I had little very little experience 👀 As for ambassadors hmmmmm I think we’ll just have to wait and see~!!</p><p>\nI’ve said this a lot on stream and I won’t ever stop recommending Yogyakarta! It’s a province with more Indonesian cultures and is budget-friendly, even for Indonesians! ✨️<p>\nThere’s also Lembang, it’s high in the mountains and it has beautiful scenery and lots of tourist spots! It’s definitely a local go-to 🌄✨️</p></p><p>\nSomeone who’s professional but also friendly! Having too much of one of these qualities makes it a bit hard for me to lead/follow, so definitely someone that has a good balance in between!👍</p><p>\nBlue Prince! I’ve been wanting to play it but I keep forgetting 😩</p><p>\nMy family was financially in the gutters and I had to share a meal with 4 of my family members… I couldn’t do the things that I wanted because there was no money for it, and I had a student loan with my uncle. The only thing I did was study and survive. Being in hololive changed my whole life, and my family’s too. I get to do the things I want and get an income out of it- I wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world 🫶💞</p><p>\nAs a fan-turned-idol, I like how I’m able to see what both worlds look like- I love how I can nerd out with fans and also work towards the same goals with my beloved hololivers 🫶💖</p><p>\nI visioned myself just playing games, now I’m performing for world tour 👁👄👁 I honestly don’t know what the future holds~</p><p>\nSchedules and staying relevant is hard- You can’t come up with banger tweets everyday and there’s so much more to vtubing than just streaming so it gets hard 😭😭</p><p>\nThis is pretty much impossible, but I kinda want to see hololive making its own anime series 👀</p><p>\nWanting to go to hololive pop-up stores/collab cafes</p><p>\nI’ve always wanted to be a voice actor, but I couldn’t be one so VTuber is kinda my next best thing 👉👈</p><p>\nI’m optimistic that it’ll only grow bigger from now! hololive has also been cooking so many innovations behind the screen, so I’m confident to say that maybe we’ll be as well-known as Hatsune Miku! 🔥🔥</p><p>\nThere’s a solo concert that I really want to do, but I think that’s still a long way for me!</p><p>\nI mostly remember the down parts, there was actually a time where I would cry on membership streams for a whole year every week lol (I’m all fine now tho! :DDD) And I think my peak is actually right now?! I’ve beem provided so many great opportunities, holoplus include 🥹🫶💞 (thanks holoplus team 🫰) As for nendoroids and figmas, we’ll just have to be patient! It takes two to tango and hololive is doing their best to get us the nendos! ✨️✨️</p><p>\nSomeone who makes other people happy by doing what they love 💖</p><p>\n1. holoplus is a space where you could oshikatsu TO THE MAX with fan focused features and the latest oshi news! 2. I hope more people will use holoplus more because it’s honestly so convenient! Also I hope that the features that are being cooked gets released soon uashdvaudva the team is working sooo harddd❤️‍❤️‍</p><p>\nAMOGUS</p><p>\nThe hololive song that I listen to the most has to be “A Horny Money World”!! I’ve been listening to it ever since Marine-senpai’s live 🔥🔥</p><p>\nIt’s still my proudest piece yet! My hololive Medllie (Medley + Ollie)✨️✨️ It’s my gratitude for hololive fans and the hololive talents that kept on inspiring me 💞💞</p><p>\nMau jadi ambassador UNIQLO, sama-sama merah uwu</p><p>\nKanata-senpai’s “Bessekai” is my ultimate favorite, it’s so beautiful and delicate, the lyrics are relatable for me and I find it poetic and beautiful 💙</p><p>\nIt was a recent stream, but I really like the Valentine’s stream I did this 2025! The one with the maid competition! It was so fun to plan something so simple yet so fun! It doesn’t have the most views, but I felt nothing but joy for that one stream~</p><p>\nOkay IMAGINE THIS: ✨️A BACKSCRATCHER IN THE FORM OF OLLIE’S ARM✨️ hehe~ My zomily gave me this idea and I’d LOVE for this to happen 🥹🥹💞 *winkwonkmanagementpleaseletthisbeathing</p><p>\nReine is the “putri merak yang tertiup angin”, meaning she’s a peafowl princess blown from the wind, so I think it’d be SICK to make a fan (literal fan) merch for her! 🌬💨🍃</p><p>\nEveryone’s faces and reactions, of course! Seeing you guys are what I’m most excited about 🫰💞💞 (setidaknya bisa lihat muka)</p><p>\nIS THAT EVEN A QUESTION⁉️⁉️💖💞❣️🌷🔥✨️🎉💃</p><p>\nBeing a vtuber is COSTLY; even as a corp Vtuber, I put out so much of my savings for projects like 3D Lives, original songs, collab projects, etc! So make sure you’re doing this because you like Vtubing. Please don’t pressure yourself to make covers or big projects if you’re not emotionally, mentally, or financially prepared. You don’t need to rush, things takes time, so be kind to yourself and your wallet.</p><p>\n✨️THEIR WITTINESS✨️ When Vtubers know the perfect things to say on the perfect time, that’s the ideal Vtuber~ A few examples are Laplus and Fubuki-senpai!</p><p>\nI’ll be frank, the bar is VEEEEERYYYY high right now… The only tip that I can give you is if you have a talent/personality that hololive doesn’t have yet! Let’s say for example uh… An opera singer?</p><p>\nMy first ever work from holoplus was to give them ideas and suggestions on what the talents/fans would maybe like to see in holoplus! This QnA is actually my second work as the ambassador, and we’ll have plenty of fun things prepared in the future!</p><p>\nThere’s so many questions asking what I’m most excited for and I can’t actually tell you guys cause it’s going to be a surprise 👀</p><p>\nThings aren’t always that complicated, slow down and take your time processing everything uwu (I was very impatient back then)</p><p>\nThis is a tough one 🤔 I’ve had my dream collab with Indomie/PopMie, so I never really thought about it! But if I had to shoot for the sky… CROCS!! I love wearing Crocs!! :DDD</p><p>\nDulu Ollie dipaksa harus tinggalin mimpi Ollie hanya karena nggak mampu… Pas denger audisi Vtuber, bagi Ollie itu bagaikan kesempatan terakhir Ollie untuk wujudin mimpi- jadi Ollie kejar terus sampe dapet pokoknya!!!</p><p>\nI feel like we can determine the vector by considering “does this degrade my oshi” and “will this offend anyone else than my oshi”! It might be a hardline to read especially if you’re trying to do an edgy joke, so I usually rewrite my jokes so that it’s a lot more seiso!</p><p>\nDifferent types of music inspires me in different ways! As for lately, I’ve been inspired by cute-kawaii pop songs! 🫶🌷🍓✨️</p><p>\nLucu aja AOWKOWKWOWKWOK</p><p>\nInternet connections/obs dying 🥲 I also hate it when I get one-guyed, I hate myself whenever I fall for it 😭😭</p><p>\nI dream of a collab with JaidenAnimations (now that she’s also a vtuber!), maybe a Pokémon collab?? uuuuuuu that’d be great 🥹🥹</p><p>\nCyndaquil LOVE 🫶🔥</p><p>\nI don’t know if other countries have this or not, but we have QRIS where we pay everything with a QR code 📲 And I think we use QR codes for a lot of stuffs! Social media, restaurant menus, transactions, etc! Pretty handy! OH and we also rent powerbanks in malls so that’s a win too~</p><p>\nI understand 😭😭 Mostly because textbook Indonesian and daily Indonesian are completely different 😭😭 My tips is to have conversations or listen to a lot of Indonesian conversation! SHOCK THERAPHY BABY 🔥🔥 That’s how I forced myself to speak Japanese when I didn’t know the language!</p><p>\nI’m flattered omg??? 😭😭 Thank you, I’m glad you see me as a nice person 🥹🥹 It’s weird giving out advice for kindness, but I usually treat people the way I want them to treat me- so because I’m a needy girl then I try to provide as much care to the people around me! If I were having a bad day, I for sure would love to have someone to cheer me up 🫶</p><p>\nI think you’re talking about kanjis, and the advice that I got from my JP senpais is: don’t sweat the kanjis! JP peeps have trouble with kanjis too wwwwwww But definitely start slow, if you haven’t had your hiragana down then try writing two full pages of 1 letter every single day! That’s how I learned Japanese, and even Arabic! It’s tedious, but this method makes hiragana/katakana stick to me faster!</p><p>\nHonestly, it’ll be easier to learn Japanese once you have the basics down! Start by learning hiragana, and if you’re feeling it, you can try katakana too! After you learn the alphabets, learn how to use Japanese particles like を, に, で, の, は, が etc! I suggest studying from Kirakira nihongo! It’s very easy to follow! After that, just practice your Japanese with a friend or watch JP media without relying on subs! That’s how I learned them! :DDD</p><p>\nPertanyaannya bikin greget ya- hmm… Boneka Miteiru Jumbo dari Shirakami Fubuki, karena bisa jadi bantal buat ditidurin-</p><p>\nWATCHING VTUBERS FOR 7 YEARS⁉️⁉️ YOU’RE 14⁉️⁉️⁉️🤯🤯 WOW– UM– I really hope you’ve been watching the family-friendly talents kEKW You’ve been watching hololive longer than I have, so I think you should have a proper idea of what hololive looks for in a talent! A lot of factors play into the audition, but what matters is how determined you are in becoming one of us!! ✨️ ONLY audition when you’ve reached age requirement tho, okay?</p><p>\nThat’s not the only thing we see 👁👁</p><p>\nI DID………. But then I realized how expensive that would be so I scratched the idea hehe</p><p>\nPssst don’t tell them but ummm… It’s Kiara-senpai and FUWAMOCO 👉👈💖</p><p>\namiiiiiiiiin 🙏</p><p>\nRather than having all of the MMDs public, I think it’s best to do whatever makes the talents happy! Whether they want their MMDs public, or if they want it private 🫶❣️</p><p>\nLike, comment, follow, subscribe~ (no like for real dO IT NOW)</p><p>\nLaplus, I’ve noticed that she’s just so unapologetically her around everyone- She brought a toy horse back stage during holofes for good luck-</p><p>\nDefinitely Ina! And always will be Ina! WAH</p><p>\nElizabeth because she is SUCH a gentlewoman UGHHH💖💖💞💞</p><p>\nI’m sorry Shiori but I stan BloodRaven 💄🎼🫶💖 I’ve carried Kobo plenty of times so yeah!</p><p>\nRoboco, Akirose, Subaru (Choco-sensei is curved but something about Subaru-senpai’s hips got me 😳😳), Marine, Watame I guess?? (gen 4 only has cute members now), Botan, Lui, Ririka, Chihaya, Moona, Reine, Zeta, Kiara, Kronii, Nerissa, Raora- phewww those are my opinions!</p><p>\nIt was the holoplus team that reached out to me first and offered me this amazing opportunity! Having given this honorable role, I aspire to invite the community towards a more OSHIKATSU community space and make connections between fans and talents! (I’ll drink water now hehe thank you)</p><p>\nholoplus is honestly an app that I’ve been dreaming of existing (and I’m not saying this because I’m the ambassador hehe) Our focus gets scattered when using other social medias because of outside interest and recommended posts, while in holoplus, we get to entirely invest our focus to hololive! I don’t have to open the hololive schedule website to check for streams, I could do it in holoplus! If I want to know the latest news like new outfits or even 3D Lives, holoplus got me covered! It’s honestly so convenient, I’m just waiting for my own official holoplus account so that I could just start posting here adsfgfhjisheb</p><p>\nOllie ingin lebih banyak berinteraksi dengan kalian para fans! Waktu jadi ambassador holomeet, Ollie nggak terlalu banyak bekerja- jadi kali ini Ollie pengen lebih aktif lagi!</p><p>\nI’ve given all my ideas to the holoplus team already and a few of them they are already working on so I’ll let this be a surprise for now~</p><p>\nYES</p><p>\nTo drag all of you and use this superior app MWAHAHHAHAHAH</p><p>\nWHY WOULD I THINK TWICE ABOUT BECOMING THE AMBASSADOR OF THE HOLOLIVE OSHIKATSU SOCIAL MEDIA??? IT WAS AN IMMEDIATE YESSSS</p><p>\nUm… Blend in… Yeah…</p><p>\nPros, you’re already dead so nothing kills you and you can pop your head whenever! 🧟‍♀️✨️ Cons, body parts are basically rotting so it’s prone to illnesses and injuries 💦</p><p>\nCYBOOOOORGGG YEAHHHH LASER EYESSSSSSS 🔥🔥🔥</p><p>\n1000 BAJILLION DOLLARS🤑🤑</p><p>\nI’ve always loved Elephants!🐘💖</p><p>\n“Shampoo… *screams at the sight of soap*”</p><p>\nHard question because every vocaloid song is so good- But the first song that popped in my head was “Neko Neko☆Super Fever Night” because it’s just so hype and I LOVE listening to the niconico utaites singing it together 🐱🐾 Favorite composer is DECO*27! He was the one who made my entire childhood with all his songs, so when I sang the chorus for ZOMBIE it was like a dream come true!!🥰🥰</p><p>\nINAZUMA ELEVEN ⚽️⚡️</p><p>\nDoes Raimon Eleven from Inazuma Eleven count-</p><p>\nI was actually shocked that everybody was so supportive! I was ready for people to ramble at me about diet plans and work-out tips- but everybody embraced the chubby belly?!?!?😳😳</p><p>\nBoring answer: I like spending time with friends and family; Other answer: Stalk fan’s twitter accounts</p><p>\nI love comfy and long dresses; I’ve been looking into modern hanfus and traditional qipaos lately!</p><p>\nTshirts at home- Just Tshirts uwu</p><p>\nGolf is something that I’ve been dying on trying! You just hit a ball and walk with your friends across the field-</p><p>\nAquariums for sure! It’s just somehow more romantic~</p><p>\n🫂</p><p>\nI’m sorry Shiori but I stan BloodRaven 💄🎼🫶💖 I’ve carried Kobo plenty of times so yeah!</p><p>\nI’ll be so honest with you guys I don’t wishlist or check for sales in Steam at all 😭😭 I usually just buy whatever the other members are playing 🥹🥹</p><p>\nIf you’re going to Jakarta, please please PLEASE wear a facemask 😭😭</p><p>\nI guess it’d have to be a Yakitori! It’s basically just a chicken skewer, so I grade them the same level as Satay!🍢</p><p>\nI like anything doughy! Like cake batter ice cream!</p><p>\nIt came after I accidentally mistook chocomint ice cream for matcha, my world completely CHANGED</p><p>\nIndomie! :DDD</p><p>\nI’ve never tried it! But I did had a funny story regarding it, apparently a few content creators mistook me for a Philipino and thought that my concept was a knock on Jollibee skskksksks</p><p>\nI’d take them to a Padang Restaurant! They serve a bunch of menus at once even before you order, I think that would be an experience!</p><p>\nRelax and be confident! You just have to look cool to convince the HR team!</p><p>\nNo, I’m Indonesian and cheese is so expensive owo</p><p>\nYASSSS</p><p>\nLITERALLY PLEASE INVITE ME TO ANY HAWAII CONVENTIONS I WOULD LOVE TO GO 😭😭</p><p>\nSwiss has been in my bucket list for sooo longg</p><p>\nA glass cabinet!</p><p>\nI’m so bad with horror games KSKSKSKKSKS, but I’m surprisingly unfazed with horror movies/series!</p><p>\nI tried practicing with it but there never was a good moment to actually use it so I just rusted uwu</p><p>\nA lot actually! I get to constantly talk about holoplus, advertise the f out of it, even make streams using holoplus! That’s a plan for another day though~</p><p>\nholoplus is scarily advanced, there’re so many language options, they have channels for different type of posts you want to see, and everything loads like SUPER FAST??? It’s honestly so insane-</p><p>\nThis is so embarrassing to answer, but the team said something along the lines of “Ollie is the perfect ambassador and we are confident that you can help us connect to the fans all over the world” uuuuuuu ///////////</p><p>\nCanggih sedap skuy skuy cukurukuk</p><p>\nI might be more active here than in other social medias in the future KEK</p><p>\nI actually love when there’re posts where you guys start discussing and replying to each other, though it’s been really quiet in here… 👀</p><p>\nNot gonna lie, when they first shared the idea of holoplus to the talents, I thought that it’d be hard to achieve because this is essentially making their own social media- so I was actually super surprised at how well made holoplus came to be! Color me surprised when holoplus actually cooked and served! The team did SUCH A GREAT JOB!!!!!</p><p>\nThemed UI would be cool no?! Imagine an Ollie-themed holoplus when you open the app!!!!✨️✨️</p><p>\nDark mode is always a go-to~</p><p>\nI think it’d be pretty rad if we could connect and multistream our streams in holoplus! Maybe the people watching from holoplus can send in cute stickers on stream or something!</p><p>\nCustom hololive production talents notification sounds! This might sound simple, but if we were to involve all of the talents… Hmm…</p><p>\nI’m so blessed and honored to be trusted with such an amazing role TTTT The team is also so nice to me it’s just so fun being an ambassador!! &lt;3</p><h3>Join the holoplus Community!</h3><p>holoplus offers an extensive variety of content, including original content unique to holoplus that can be enjoyed by everyone, as well as exclusive information in collaboration with large-scale events!</p><p>Join and take part in building a community for all fans!</p>","contentLength":19586,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Meeting the Tenchou: A Conversation with Takanashi Kiara -
