The process starts with creating a proposal and presenting it internally, and once it gets approved, we send an offer to the talent and move on to developing the script.<p>To go into a little more detail, the staff member in charge also handles things like commissioning jacket illustrations, creating banners for sales pages, and preparing promotional videos and X posts ready for a pack’s release.&nbsp;</p><p>There are two main ways we offer voice packs roles to talents. The first is a survey-based approach. For large projects that involve many talents, such as Christmas or Valentine’s Day, we send out a survey in advance to see who’s interested in participating.</p><p>The other way is then, of course, individual offers to specific talents. We regularly watch all of the talents’ streams and look for those who would be a good fit for a particular project we’re planning. Or sometimes it works the other way around – we see something on a stream and realize “Oh, this talent really likes that kind of theme,” and then create a project based on that.&nbsp;</p></p>","contentLength":1219,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Ueda Shuhei, COVER Director, on the Journey Toward Becoming an Essential Presence in the Global Content Industry","url":"https://coveredge.cover-corp.com/en/list/3368","date":1763002800,"author":"cover_hirata","guid":1379,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I believe that our greatest strength lies in the incredible passion of our fans. At hololive production, streaming is at the core of what we do. Those streams ignite enthusiasm among our viewers, which then carries over to music concerts, creating a powerful cycle of energy and connection. At those live events, fans come together again and celebrate a common passion, and that passion continues to spread, building a strong sense of unity throughout the community. The thought of how we can carry that passion forward and make it resonate with fans around the world is incredibly exciting.<p>The atmosphere at trading card game tournaments is a little more subdued than that of live concerts, yet it’s common to see players meeting for the first time start their conversations with a question like, “Who’s your </p>?”, leading to spontaneous interactions among fans. The more touchpoints fans have with each other in different settings, the more the community grows, and that’s where we see exciting chemistry start to build.&nbsp;<p>It’s precisely because of such incredible passion from our fans that we’re able to explore many different business opportunities to attempt to meet their expectations. We took on a new challenge in the trading card game space last year, and starting next fiscal year, we’ll be launching a full-scale game business as well. By responding to our fans’ desire for new kinds of experiences, and by offering opportunities that differ from what we’ve done before, we’re able to create entirely new ways for them to enjoy and engage with our content.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve been in the entertainment industry for a long time, but I’ve never seen this level of passion anywhere else. Meeting fans in person and feeling their energy firsthand is incredibly inspiring for me. That’s why I make a point to attend every live concert I can, and I also try to visit trading card game tournaments and shop events whenever possible.</p></p>","contentLength":1949,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"カバー株式会社（5253）2026/Q2決算分析 増収減益も営業利益は+10.2%会社予想を上振れ、好悪材料が混在［2025.11.11］","url":"https://note.com/karuta54/n/na2d12b5b6755","date":1762879531,"author":"","guid":1376,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"カバー株式会社 2026年/Q2決算展望 タレント卒業による業績影響は底打ちを想定［2025.11.3］","url":"https://note.com/karuta54/n/n5e623143e55e","date":1762097407,"author":"","guid":1354,"unread":true,"content":"<p name=\"166e7d98-a8e8-4672-b802-263b5150d8ce\">　2025年11月11日にVTuberグループ・ホロライブプロダクションを運営するカバー株式会社（証券コード：5253）2026/Q2決算発表が予定されております。　当記事ではプレスリリースやIR情報などの公開情報を基に、決算における注目ポイントの事前整理や今後の動向を考察していきたいと思います。</p><a href=\"https://note.com/karuta54/n/n5e623143e55e\">続きをみる</a>","contentLength":408,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Summer Internship 2025: Learning About Business Strategy and Production","url":"https://coveredge.cover-corp.com/en/list/3223","date":1761188400,"author":"cover_hirata","guid":1255,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>What is COVER’s Summer Internship?</h2><p>It was another scorching hot summer this year – how did everyone spend it?</p><p>In mid-August, COVER held a three-day hands-on Summer Internship program designed for students to experience business production and learn how to structure business development through practical exercises. Through the program, participants had the opportunity to experience the actual process of creating new business ideas, particularly in the entertainment industry, and to receive direct feedback from upper management. The internship aims to give students a firsthand understanding of COVER’s approach to business strategy and how new projects are brought to life.&nbsp;</p><p>We spoke with the team in charge of the Summer Internship to learn more about its purpose.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;“The purpose of this program is to give participating students the opportunity to learn and experience the following three key aspects:</p><ul><li>To understand the strategic thinking and processes behind management within the entertainment industry</li><li>To experience the planning and development processes of business projects within the entertainment field</li><li>To gain a firsthand understanding of COVER’s new business creation centered on VTubers, while receiving mentorship and feedback from professionals on-site.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>That’s why, for the Summer Internship 2025, we set a clear goal: to deliver presentations from multiple perspectives and receive direct feedback from the executive team.&nbsp;</p><p>At COVER, the Corporate Planning Division plays a vital role in, not simply coming up with ideas, but bringing those ideas to life, supporting them, putting them on a stable trajectory and ensuring they are profitable. Through this internship, we wanted students to understand the process and approach required to turn a business concept into reality as we believe that understanding this kind of thinking and workflow will serve them well in any career path they pursue – whether as working professionals or as future members of a corporate planning team.”</p><h2>Experiencing Business Production in COVER’s Corporate Planning Division</h2><p>So what exactly did the Summer Internship 2025 look like?</p><p>This year’s program invited nine students, who were divided into teams of three, to take on a three-day challenge in business production.</p><p>Here is how the three-day program unfolded:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Day 1 ― Group Work Begins</strong></p><p>The program kicked off with an opening meeting, followed by introductions to members of the Corporate Planning Division who would be supporting the students as mentors throughout the internship. After a casual lunch where everyone got to know each other a little better, the mentors gave an overview of COVER’s main areas of business, adjacent industries, and potential markets before students were divided into their respective teams and their group work finally began!</p><p><strong>Day 2 ― Creating Proposals for a  New Business”</strong></p><p>Day 2 began with a quick morning meeting before diving straight into group work. Students were not just merely coming up with business ideas – if they stayed as “pie-in-the-sky” concepts, the experience would not have been quite as meaningful. With guidance from their mentors, students learned how to analyze businesses, design new business plans, and evaluate profitability and risk, as they continued to expand and shape their ideas. The group work continued after lunch, and the day wrapped up with progress reports and feedback sessions as everyone prepared for the final presentations.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Day 3 ― Bringing It All Together: Presenting Before the Executive Team</strong></p><p>The final day also began with group work after the customary morning meeting. To ensure each group’s well-thought-out business ideas came across clearly, mentors shared tips on how to deliver effective presentations and helped the students refine their proposal materials. At 5 p.m. on the final day, the presentations began with CEO Tanigo and other members of the executive team in attendance.&nbsp;</p><h3>Final Day Presentation Report</h3><p>Summer Internship presentations were governed by three main rules: (1) 15 minutes for the presentation and 5 minutes for Q&amp;A, (2) strict time management, (3) no updates to the materials after submission. With those rules in place, each team arrived early at the venue alongside their mentors from the Corporate Planning Division to carefully go over their presentation materials.</p><p>As the clock neared 5 p.m. and the presentations were about to begin, members of the executive team started to fill out the venue one after another; the interns focused and determined. The session began with each team giving their presentation, followed by Q&amp;A sessions with the executives. After a short break, the event concluded with the awarding of the Excellence Award and feedback from CEO Tanigo.</p><p>Proposals included a social contribution project that utilizes COVER’s motion tracking technology to digitize and pass down the skills of experienced professionals, an immersive theme park concept where fans and talents can go between each other’s worlds, and a digital tabletop figure device designed to enhance and support fans’  activities.</p><p>During the feedback session, executives praised the students for their fresh perspectives and out-of-the-box thinking when coming up with ideas not bound by the conventions of the VTuber industry, as well as the feasibility of their proposals. This&nbsp; also served as the perfect opportunity for executives to share their insights on COVER’s vision for the future and offering practical advice on how to approach business planning.&nbsp;</p><h2>Looking Back on Summer Internship 2025</h2><h3>Feedback from Participants</h3><ul><li>We received feedback from perspectives we’d never considered before. It really made me realize the sincerity behind the advice we were given.&nbsp;</li><li>It was an invaluable experience to hear directly from the company’s top executives.</li><li>Through this experience, I learned that creating a business isn’t just about coming up with ideas. It’s about analyzing successful cases, understanding their core elements, and finding ways to differentiate them. The insights I gained here will definitely help shape my future approach to business.</li><li>I was able to move past surface-level trends for success and develop a more fundamental way of thinking. Getting direct feedback from the executives also helped me understand how real business decisions are made: something that will surely be a major asset in my career.&nbsp;</li><li>The mentoring sessions were especially meaningful. Every conversation was packed with insights and learning.</li></ul><h3>Reflections from the Program Coordinator</h3><h4>On the Final Day Presentations</h4><p>What stood out was how seriously each team considered the question “Why COVER be the one to take on this business idea?”</p><p>Their approaches were truly diverse – some worked backward from COVER’s strengths, others analyzed markets that could be accessed from our existing areas of business, and some made sure their ideas were grounded in solid reasoning to address real-world challenges. Rather than simply envisioning a “New business,” they kept asking themselves what it truly means for COVER to lead such an initiative giving depth and credibility to every proposal, which is what left the strongest impression on me.&nbsp;</p><p>What stood out to me was how each team built their projects around open discussions. Every member’s ideas could be seen in the final presentations – a true reflection of how well they collaborated.<p>We also held a short mid-program sharing session, where each team had five minutes to share their progress, challenges, and proposed solutions. Hearing other teams’ perspectives sparked new ideas and helped participants have a fresh take on their own projects and spot missing elements in their own proposals, expanding the scope of their learning. The sharing session encouraged more open communication within and across teams, which I believe ultimately led to higher quality presentations.</p></p><p>COVER continues to grow under its mission, “Together, Let’s Create Culture Loved by All,” driven by the challenge of elevating VTubers into a culture loved by people around the world. COVER’s greatest strength lies in its personnel – professionals from diverse backgrounds in creative, business, and technology, who respect and inspire one another and work together to achieve a common goal.&nbsp;</p><p>This internship offers a special opportunity to experience the passion and business innovation that drive COVER.</p><p>We’re excited to see the participants go on to create  that inspires people around the world together with COVER!&nbsp;</p>","contentLength":8545,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null}],"tags":["COVER"]}
