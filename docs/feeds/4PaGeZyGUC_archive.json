Humanity is facing serious disputes over our most important resource. What impact is our lifestyle having on our planet's water cycles?\n\nAlong six rivers on four continents, the documentary explores the question of why this vital resource, water, is becoming increasingly scarce - and who‚Äôs responsible. 70 per cent of fresh water is used in agriculture. And a large proportion of this goes into the production of animal feed. Our excessive meat consumption is partly to blame for the fact that mighty rivers such as the Spanish Ebro or the Colorado in the USA and Mexico are drying up. Factory farming businesses are worth billions to major agricultural companies, but this overuse of water often goes hand in hand with its pollution. Europe has outsourced its dirtiest industries to countries such as India. Around 20 per cent of global water pollution is caused by the textile industry. The film provides rare insights into Indian factories and life in the places where contaminants are discharged.\n\nBut it‚Äôs not all bad news. In the film, we also meet people who‚Äôve come up with solutions. In France, dams are dismantled to revitalize rivers; in an Egyptian oasis the inhabitants experiment with hydroponics; and in India, an individual known as the \"water man‚Äù uses a millennia-old technique to coax rivers from deserts that dried up decades ago.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

They are one of the most expressive and productive languages yet remain relatively unknown.T hey are still used heavily in financial markets globally. Array developers made the first wide spread use of learning by katas and patterns, then called idioms, and including the now pervasive map reduce. The dynamic Array languages originated with APL followed by APL2, NIAL, J and k.\n\nOften considered high barrier languages, we argue that they are much like a challenging instrument that when mastered allow to make amazing music with seeming little effort. We will also discuss why Vector programming is a natural low impedance approach for dealing with today‚Äôs high performance NoSQL and NewSQL column stores.\n\nIn the late 60s and early 70s Fortran, Lisp, COBOL, APL and Basic were the hot languages. Lisp, APL and later Basic pioneered the ‚Äúthe repl‚Äù of interactive computing. APL provides an efficient array/vector language for numeric computing. and found wide acceptance in financial, engineering and statistical computing. APL inspired ‚Äì the Smalltalk environment; array extensions in other general languages such as Python NumPy and NamedTuple; F-Script for IOS Cocoa; special purpose languages such as MatLab and R; to recent proposed extensions for value types in Java; along with special purpose vector hardware like GPUs and recent Intel AVX instructions.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nKevlin Henney ‚Ä¢ 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/2Yahf9U\nHenney &amp; Monson-Haefel ‚Ä¢ 97 Things Every Software Architect Should Know ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3pZuHsQ\nMatthew Skelton &amp; Manuel Pais ‚Ä¢ Team Topologies ‚Ä¢ http://amzn.to/3sVLyLQ\nMichael Jackson ‚Ä¢ Software Requirements and Specifications ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3ql2T14\nGeoffrey West ‚Ä¢ Scale ‚Ä¢ http://amzn.to/3eKMbpc\nDonald G.

When are these advantages likely (and unlikely) to translate to other businesses? And how can a business responsibly evaluate if the same advantages are available in their particular case?

The story begins a few weeks after the death of Jina Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish student who died on 16 September 2022.\n\nShe had allowed a few strands of hair to escape from her veil. Members of the Iranian morality police beat her so severely that she died of her injuries. The regime in Tehran has denied all responsibility for her death, which triggered nationwide mass protests under a slogan that echoed all around the world: \"Woman, Life, Freedom‚Äù.\n\nIranian filmmaker Shorresh Afkari filmed in secret, smuggling the footage out of the country to a colleague in France. His documentary gives a voice to people who, like large sections of the Iranian population, have run out of strength and patience.\n\nFor example, the film observes a young couple who dream of being able to express their love openly and in complete freedom. We also meet a taxi driver, who ends up in prison as a bitter opponent of the regime. His mother tries to protect him at all costs. A painter continues to practise her art despite censorship; a doctor secretly treats demonstrators. A young man is prepared to do anything for cash, even sell one of his kidneys. Just like men who dare to protest, women who show their hair in public and publicly oppose the regime still face harsh punishment, including the death penalty. For this reason, many interviewees speak off-camera to protect their anonymity.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #iran \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

But the uprisings would end in disaster. \n\nIn this final episode of our Gulf War series, we‚Äôll explore the aftermath of the war. Why did the uprisings fail? Why didn‚Äôt the Coalition intervene? And how did the Gulf War set the stage for the 2003 invasion of Iraq? \n\nExplore and licence the film clips used in this video from IWM Film: \nhttps://film.iwmcollections.org.uk/collections/_DEbW5lOw\n\nFollow IWM on social media:\nhttps://twitter.com/I_W_M\nhttps://www.instagram.com/imperialwarmuseums\nhttps://www.facebook.com/iwm.london\n\n#war  #history  #desertstorm\n\nIraqi GDP Data: Foote, Christopher &amp; Crane, Keith &amp; Block, William &amp; Gray, Simon.

While social media has helped tourism boom and brought prosperity to the region, it also poses a threat to the landscape and its unique historical heritage.\n\nCappadocia draws more than four million tourists every year. The region in Turkey is famous for its extraordinary \"fairy chimneys\" - carved-out boulders, some of which are still inhabited. This wonderland became a UNESCO World Heritage Site decades ago.\nEvery day, hot air balloons carrying tourists drift across valleys dotted with \"fairy chimneys.\" The rock formations, the hot air balloons, the sunrise - the setting couldn't be more instagrammable.\nMustafa K√∂se knows exactly how to get the perfect shot that tourists want for their social media posts. \"Cultural tourism is dead,\" the photographer says - all people want now is something to show off with on Instagram. It's a development he struggles with, even though he makes a decent living giving the tourists what they want. \nZehra Demircan took over her father's \"cave hotel\" a couple of years ago. He did his best to preserve the family's \"fairy chimneys\" in their original state so that the accommodation still provides an authentic glimpse of Cappadocia. Zehra Demircan is following suit, modernizing the hotel as carefully as possible. Like Mustafa K√∂se, she sometimes feels conflicted about her visitors. \"We had a group here who didn't visit anything for the entire week,\" she says. \"The whole time, they just took photos for social media.\"\nLocal activist M√ºkremin Tokmak has been fighting for years against the destruction of this unique landscape. He was appalled by the construction of a highway cutting through the historical region, paving the way for even more tourism. He documents the effects of the construction work on the valleys and the old churches that stood here. He hasn't given up hope that tourism can be held in check. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #cappadocia #instagram #turkey \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Paul Mecurio answer fan questions about particle colliders, time travel, and what existed before the Big Bang. \n\nThe discussion begins with the Superconducting Super Collider ‚Äì the massive Texas project that could have revolutionized particle physics in the US if it hadn‚Äôt been canceled. How might scientific breakthroughs have been different if the collider had been completed? Neil explains how the cancellation shifted the epicenter of particle physics to Europe and what that meant for the discovery of the Higgs boson.\n\nFrom there, they explore the big questions: What existed before the Big Bang? Could we ever accelerate time to visit the past? We explore the multiverse, time dilation, and the poetic nature of scientific inquiry. Along the way, they discuss how science poses better questions rather than always finding answers, with nods to Isaac Newton and Star Trek‚Äôs influence on popular culture.\n\nAre we made of stardust? Neil breaks down the cosmic origins of the elements in our bodies and what the future of human evolution might hold.

But in Germany, almost all the country‚Äôs natural peatlands have been drained. Now, they‚Äôre emitting greenhouse gases. People around the world are currently working to rewet the moors - while keeping them usable for agriculture.\n\nDry peatlands are responsible for seven percent of all greenhouse gas emissions in Germany. Taken together, all the moorland areas in Germany cover over 1.5 million hectares. However, much of this moorland has given way to pasture and arable land over the centuries. Drained, the moors lose their ability to store greenhouse gases. In Germany alone, they could store about as much carbon as the entire German forest - but they must remain wet.\n\nScientists Greta Gaudig and Sabine Wichmann from the \"Greifswald Moor Centrum‚Äù are working on a strategy to rewet the moors, while keeping them usable for agriculture. To accomplish this, they are testing the cultivation of peat mosses and cattails. These materials could be used to produce environmentally friendly potting soil and building materials. This way, farmers could continue generating income while saving the moors.\n\nIn Bristol, young entrepreneurs are producing a sustainable down substitute using cattails. With success: because the product is selling well, several farmers in England are converting their drained fields back to wet moorland for farming. For the first time, they have found a way to protect the moors and continue to make a living from their land.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #climatechange #germany \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Some countries, including Finland, Sweden, Russia, Germany and the USA, have allowed the repatriation of IS children. But France has taken a different position, refusing to repatriate the children, unless they are orphaned. In France, their families are waging a fierce battle against the government to bring these children home. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #syria #children\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Neil deGrasse Tyson teams up with comic co-host Chuck Nice, Gary O‚ÄôReilly, and astrophysicist Charles Liu to break down our visions of the future ‚Äì and take Neil to task on his own predictions.\n\nThe conversation kicks off with the accuracy of science fiction predictions. Are we living in The Jetsons era yet? We explore the years that science fiction takes place and compare them with where we are now. From Amazon‚Äôs robotic warehouses to AI assistants, how much of our future is already here ‚Äì and what did sci-fi get wrong?\n\nWe break down technology in Blade Runner, Black Mirror, and The Twilight Zone and question whether we‚Äôre headed straight towards a dystopian future. We discuss the purpose of predictions and how they can help us not only inform our future but act as an early warning sign. \n\nPlus, we discuss the Turing test and whether what we really need is a test for consciousness. Do we even need machines to mimic human thought? Can technology ever fully control human perception, or is that a fear rooted in fiction?\n\nLooking to 2050, Neil shares predictions from his book Starry Messenger, including the rise of commercial space industries and self-driving cars. Will neuroscience cure mental illness? Will space tourism become a booming industry? Plus, Charles, Chuck, and Gary add their own predictions of the future to the conversation. \n\nTimestamps: \n00:00 - Introduction: Charles Liu\n05:22 - Making Predictions\n07:29 - The Jetsons: Life in 2062\n13:06 - Bladerunner‚Äôs Turing Test Dystopia\n19:46 - Black Mirror‚Äôs Technological Future\n25:30 - No Cloning Theorem\n28:00 - Exponential Growth\n34:16 - Sci-Fi Shaping the Future\n35:49 - Neil's predictions: Space Industry\n41:54 - Neil's predictions: Self-Driving Cars\n44:35 - Neil's predictions: Curing Mental Illness\n47:40 - The pace of Change\n49:41 - Final predictions\n\nCheck out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

Nigerian architect Kunl√© Adeyemi came up with a design that can help buildings adapt to the looming threat of climate change.   \n\nHis work began in the floating community of Makoko in the Nigerian capital Lagos. Many residents live in simple houses built on stilts over a lagoon, which makes them particularly vulnerable to rising tides and extreme weather.  \n\nInspired by local engineering, Adeyemi came up with the ‚ÄúMakoko Floating System‚Äù, which allows for buildings to float on water. Its pyramid shape makes it more stable and prevents rainwater from pooling. \n\nOn a large scale, Adeyemi hopes that his design can help Makoko, and other places around the world, adapt to the rising sea.  \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #makoko \n______\n\nWe kindly ask viewers to read and stick to the DW netiquette policy on our channel: https://p.dw.com/p/MF1G</article>","contentLength":920,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/bgKcoJ0i9mk?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Leaving Neverland II: Surviving Michael Jackson | Official Trailer | Exclusively on @RealStories","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvVhCb8XiCE","date":1742043689,"author":"Timeline - World History Documentaries","guid":346,"unread":true,"content":"<article>'Leaving Neverland 2: Surviving Michael Jackson' charts the ten-year quest by Wade Robson and  James Safechuck to have their claims heard in court against some of entertainer Michael Jackson‚Äôs companies,  which allegedly enabled and covered up years of child sexual abuse by the ‚ÄúKing of Pop‚Äù. \n\nWade and James‚Äô quest for justice began more than ten years ago when they filed civil lawsuits against some of the late entertainer‚Äôs corporations in a California court, alleging that MJJ Productions and MJJ Ventures enabled and covered up their sexual abuse as children. The Jackson lawyers have fought back, accusing the men, amongst other things, of being liars and arguing that there is no basis in law for the men‚Äôs claims. \n\nThe documentary picks up the story of the two men‚Äôs legal battles in the wake of the 2019 release of the 'Leaving Neverland' documentary, which alleged that the entertainer had sexually abused Wade and James over a period of years. In 'Leaving Neverland 2' we see Wade‚Äôs and James‚Äôs civil cases twice thrown out by the California District Court and twice reversed on appeal by the California Court of Appeals. A civil trial is set for 2026. \n\nThe documentary tells the story principally through the eyes of the two young men and their attorneys and their journey to a civil trial scheduled for 2026, often dipping behind the scenes to chronicle the emotional toll on James and his family. \n\nMaterial for the film was shot over a seven-year period and includes interviews with LAPD detectives who investigated Michael Jackson while he was alive, in which new details from the LAPD files are revealed.\n\nDirected by Dan Reed\n\nDo you love uncovering the past, exploring historic sites, and venturing to distant lands?

They discuss how modern Java performance must account for cloud native architectures, with applications running across distributed microservices and containerized, single-core environments.\n\nThe book focuses on the importance of measuring relevant data, warns against relying on misleading micro-benchmarks, and highlights how system-level benchmarks offer a clearer picture. Ben also delves into the JVM's hidden complexities, such as changes in Java 17 and the impact of virtual threads. Practical, real-world examples in the book, like the \"fighting animals\" microservices application, help developers learn how to optimize Java performance in real network environments.\n\nFinally, Ben touches on the future of Java concurrency, with virtual threads and structured concurrency offering new ways to handle performance challenges in cloud native systems.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n07:40 Who's \"Optimizing Cloud Native Java\" for?\n09:29 Performance tuning: Art &amp; science\n21:43 Java performance\n32:21 Concurrency in modern Java\n39:10 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nBen Evans &amp; Jim Gough ‚Ä¢ Optimizing Cloud Native Java ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/41nivD9\nBen Evans, Jason Clark &amp; David Flanagan ‚Ä¢ Java in a Nutshell ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/43FDoMA\nBen Evans, Martijn Verburg &amp; Jason Clark ‚Ä¢ The Well-Grounded Java Developer ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/41JMG7N\nBen Evans, Jim Gough &amp; Chris Newland ‚Ä¢ Optimizing Java ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4bNOfGh\nBen Evans &amp; Martijn Verburg ‚Ä¢ The Well-Grounded Java Developer ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4hs9MWk\nGoetz, Peierls, Bloch, Bowbeer, Holmes &amp; Lea ‚Ä¢ Java Concurrency in Practice ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4215zo6\nVenkat Subramaniam ‚Ä¢ Cruising Along with Java ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4dFuBwU\nMonica Beckwith ‚Ä¢ JVM Performance Engineering ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3BkRoiO\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#PerformanceEngineering #JVM #JVMPerformanceEngineering #Observability #HardwareInnovation #Java #JavaProgramming #JavaPerformance #JavaConcurrency #Concurrency #CloudNative #CloudNativeJava #GraalVM #Quarkus #SoftwareEngineering #Programming #BenEvans #Kittylyst #HollyCummins #BookClub\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

Anyone who makes it to one of its 84 institutes belongs to the elite: an organization that counts 31 Nobel Prize laureates among its ranks. But there is a dark side to its facade.\n \nFor months, DW's investigative unit, along with German news magazine Der Spiegel, has investigated allegations of misconduct perpetrated by senior scientific staff at Max Planck institutes. We spoke to more than 30 young scientists, many who described abusive behavior and toxic environments. They were afraid to report the abuse, fearing the consequences, and the few who did report say they were discouraged from doing so.\n \nDW goes behind the scenes of Germany's elite research institutes to find out why abusive behavior and toxic work environments remain resilient in the face of opposition.\n\n[Correction 13.03.25: In the documentary, we stated that German media had reported widespread sexual harassment perpetrated by two directors at the Ernst Str√ºngmann Institute for Neuroscience. This was incorrect. The reports referred to two senior staff members, not directors.

Bring up the railguns, let‚Äôs finish this and go home.‚Äô - MCRN Captain Theresa Yao, The Expanse, 2015\n\nElectromagnetic railguns are guns powered by electricity instead of chemical propellants. Most will be familiar with railguns as futuristic weapons featured in science fiction. To date, many countries have carried out experimental and theoretical studies of railguns but none has yet developed them into practical weapons.\n\nThe lecture will explore the scientific principles of railgun operation and some of the engineering challenges involved. Derek will also explore some of his experiences from UK experimental work from the 1980s and 1990s, when railguns were seen as potential future anti-tank weapons.\n\nThis will include the design and patenting of a railswitch breech for the RARDE experimental programme. He will shed light on the full size wooden model of the patented railswitch breech, now held in the Royal Armouries collection at Fort Nelson (object number XIX.852). He will also talk about his work on the Hyperlocity Test Facility railgun at Culham Laboratory.\n\nSubscribe to our channel for more videos about arms and armour  \n\nHelp us bring history to life by supporting us here: https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/donations/\n\nSign up to our museum membership scheme here: https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/membership/ \n\n‚öîWebsite: https://royalarmouries.org/home\n‚öîBlog: https://royalarmouries.org/stories/\n‚öîFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/RoyalArmouriesMuseum/\n‚öîTwitter: https://twitter.com/Royal_Armouries\n‚öî Instagram: http://instagram.com/royalarmouriesmuseum\n\nWe are the Royal Armouries, the United Kingdom's national collection of arms and armour.

One of them, a T-55, was 4,700 metres or nearly 3 miles away, four times the battle range of his Challenger 1. When his crew fired the main gun, the round took nearly three full seconds to reach the target. When it did, a massive fireball erupted in the distance. Purbrick‚Äôs crew had just achieved the longest tank-to-tank kill in military history. That T-55 was one of many Iraqi tanks which never even saw the enemy coming.\n\nIn this third episode of our Gulf War Series IWM Curator Megan Joyce uncovers the challenges faced by Coalition forces, the mass deception tactics employed, and the pivotal role of GPS in navigating the Iraqi desert.

So should you! These concepts are actually universal in programming. Rust's approach is to encode them into the type system and make the compiler check that you're obeying the rules (that you manually check anyway).\n\nWe'll also learn about some of its language features, including algebraic data types, error handling, and how it can guarantee that (the equivalent of) a NullPointerExeception will never occur. This language that brings memory safety to systems programming has much to share. Come and learn!

Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Paul Mecurio answer questions on the Higgs Field, dark energy, and the feasibility of Dyson spheres with astrophysicist Hakeem Oluseyi.\n\nWe discuss Hakeem‚Äôs role as CEO of the Astronomical Society, and his work on NASA‚Äôs IMAP satellite, designed to study the boundary of our solar system. He shares his vision for making astronomy more accessible, the difference between nerds and geeks, and why he doesn‚Äôt wear gold.\n\nThen, we tackle the growing mystery of the universe‚Äôs expansion. Is the Hubble tension a sign of undiscovered physics? Could our cosmological models need tweaking? We explore the role of dark energy, the Higgs field, and the unanswered questions that keep physicists awake at night.\n\nNext, we turn our sights to exoplanets. How do scientists detect distant atmospheres? What can JWST reveal? And when it comes to dark matter‚Äîcould it be defying our understanding of physics itself? We break down theories, alternative gravity models, and the possibility that new technology may finally uncover what‚Äôs been eluding us.\n\nPlus, we tackle gravitational waves and time itself‚Äîwhat would happen if we were hit by one? Is ‚Äúnow‚Äù just an illusion? We break down the Andromeda Paradox and also touch on black holes, information loss, and the search for Dyson spheres. Could an advanced civilization really build one, or is it just sci-fi fantasy? All this, plus a look at the biggest roadblock in STEM education, the history of mathematical knowledge, and how we can get more people looking up. \n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Introduction: Hakeem Oluseyi\n03:30 - The Astronomical Society @astrosocietypac \n9:31 - IMAP\n14:32 - How Do We Resolve Hubble Tension?\n25:25 - Detecting Atmospheres of Distant Planets\n27:29 - Better Tools or Better Physics to Unlock Dark Matter\n32:41 - Can Gravitational Waves Alter Time? \n37:30 - What is the Conservation of Information?\n41:01 - The Big Squeeze\n41:36 - Get Those Dyson Spheres Out of Your Head\n44:38 - Closing Thoughts\n\nCheck out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

As rents rise, so does homelessness. With no house or apartment, Jordyn, Jonathan and their young daughter Delilah have to find a new place to sleep every night.\n\nThe young family has been searching for permanent accommodation in Ireland's capital for ten months. Their everyday life involves appointments with the local authorities and endless hours spent on hold on the telephone. They are unable to afford Dublin‚Äôs high rents, and social housing seems beyond their reach. Each day, Jordyn, Jonathan and their daughter try to arrange to stay the night with friends or relatives.\n\nJustin is a social worker. He previously worked with homeless people in a privately run emergency shelter. But when the shelter was sold, he lost his job and his home. Now, he spends his days combing through offers on the overpriced housing market. But the few available homes are usually either unaffordable or unsuitable. Single rooms, and even individual beds, are being rented out at fantastical prices.\n\nConor is currently completing his doctoral thesis, and lives with his girlfriend in a tiny apartment. The housing shortage has turned him into a political activist: he‚Äôs running for a seat on the city council and helping to raise awareness of the problem. He collects signatures for a petition to stop apartments being left empty, and for more affordable housing.\n\nDespite the government‚Äôs promises, Ireland remains in the midst of a seemingly never-ending housing crisis. For Jordyn, Jonathan and little Delilah, there‚Äôs light at the end of the tunnel. But for many others, the situation remains desperate. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #ireland  #housing \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The deadly disease spread so quickly around the world that it could not be stopped with known measures.  \n\nFor many people, like C√©sar Serrano, it was as if time had stopped, ‚Äúit's as if a huge storm has come and wiped out everything. Everything is completely deserted, lifeless, closed.‚Äù \n\nIt felt like something out of a disaster movie. First came the fear of this unknown virus, followed by lockdowns. Once the first wave had passed, restrictions in some places were eased. Then came further waves and restrictions, but people got used to the changes in their daily life.  \n\nAs the pandemic entered its second year, expressions of solidarity, seen at the start, gave way to frustration and anger. People took to the streets in anti-government protests and conspiracy theories spread.

Our sponsor has no editorial influence over how we report our stories, but their support makes videos like these possible.\n\nWhen you get to a place financially where you can begin to start saving, rather than living paycheck to paycheck, a big question often comes up: ‚ÄùShould I pay off my debt or invest in the stock market?‚Äù There‚Äôs no simple answer, but there‚Äôs a simple rule of thumb that can help you decide what to do with this money to have the best financial outcome in the long run. \n\nThe first place to look is the interest rate on your debt and see if it‚Äôs below 7%, the rate of return you can conservatively expect from investing in an index fund, like the S&amp;P 500. If your debt ‚Äî like a mortgage or a student loan ‚Äî falls below 7%, it is usually mathematically more beneficial to invest in the stock market while you pay down the debt by its minimum payments. The logic being: You‚Äôll likely earn more interest by investing than your debt will accrue in that time. \n\nHigher interest rate debt, like credit card debt, should almost always be eliminated as soon as possible, since you are statistically unlikely to see a rate of return from investing past 7 to 10% annually.

They alleged that, as the co-founder of a company called HyperVerse, he‚Äôd orchestrated a cryptocurrency scam that bilked investors around the world for almost $2 billion. HyperVerse had promised returns as high as 1% a day via cutting-edge blockchain-based strategies, but according to the US Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission, it was just an old-fashioned Ponzi scheme.

That‚Äôs not new.\n\nSupport our work. Become a Vox Member today: http://www.vox.com/memberships\n\nOn the first day of Donald Trump‚Äôs second presidential term, he signed an executive order about an old American rule: that with very few exceptions, anyone born here is a citizen. Trump‚Äôs order stated that the rule, which comes from the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, should no longer apply to the children of those in the United States illegally or temporarily. Within a few weeks that order had been blocked by multiple federal judges ‚Äî but it was a temporary resolution, with the ultimate outcome yet to be determined, probably by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe US is far from the only country in the world that offers unconditional birthright citizenship. While it‚Äôs uncommon in Europe, Asia, and Africa, it‚Äôs very common among Western Hemisphere countries, partly because of their history as colonies populated mostly by settlers. But of the many countries with birthright citizenship in the world, the US is by far the largest, with hundreds of thousands of baby citizens born here every year to noncitizen parents. Those numbers naturally raise the question: Is this what birthright citizenship was meant for? And why do we have birthright citizenship in the first place?\n\nThe short answer is that birthright citizenship in the US came about as a way of granting citizenship after the American Civil War to the large population of formerly enslaved Black people. But that raises a different question: How did a law intended for Black Americans end up creating hundreds of thousands of new US citizens born to immigrant parents every year? In this video we trace that history, answer that question, and look at a few of the times that the US has actually had this argument before. Today‚Äôs concerns over birthright citizenship may feel specific to our particular immigration debate. They‚Äôre actually not.\n\n00:00 A rule\n2:23 Jus soli\n3:13 Dred Scott\n4:46 The 14th Amendment\n8:02 Wong Kim Ark\n10:30 Another look at the 14th Amendment\n\nSources and further reading:\n\nGarrett Epps‚Äôs law review article about the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment has everything you‚Äôll ever need to know about the history of birthright citizenship in the US: https://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1607&amp;context=aulr\n\nThe Library of Congress has a great map showing which countries of the world offer unconditional birthright citizenship like the US: https://maint.loc.gov/law/help/birthright-citizenship/birthright-citizenship-map.pdf\n\nThe 1861 map of the US we use a few times in the piece is itself a strikingly rich document that I could stare at forever: https://www.loc.gov/resource/g3701sm.gct00482/?sp=33\n\nSome other original documents we use in the piece:\n\nTrump‚Äôs executive order on birthright citizenship: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-01-29/pdf/2025-02007.pdf\n\nThe Ipsos poll containing the question about support for ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants: https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/f548560f100205ef/e656ddda-full.pdf\n\nThe Dred Scott decision: https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep060/usrep060393a/usrep060393a.pdf\n\nPresident Andrew Johnson‚Äôs letter vetoing the 1866 Civil Rights Act: https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/veto-message-438\n\nCongress‚Äôs debates over the 14th Amendment (we quoted from page 498): https://www.congress.gov/congressional-globe/congress-39-session-1-part-1.pdf\n\nThe 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/SERIALSET-04239_00_00-022-0291-0000/pdf/SERIALSET-04239_00_00-022-0291-0000.pdf\n\nThe Wong Kim Ark decision: https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep169/usrep169649/usrep169649.pdf\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

They were however accompanied by a comparable number of 'auxiliaries', troop recruited from conquered people without citizenship, paid half and given the dirty jobs, but eager to win the status of full Roman. Under the Empire, the army gradually evolved, including weapons and recruitment. The Germanic tries proved the ultimate challenge, their forest homelands impossible to conquer by established Riman tactics, Varrus even incurred an unprecedented defeat. Ultimately they and other 'barbarians', having learned a lot from Rome, would overrun it.\n\nDiscover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Matt Lewis and more.

These establishments were especially important for those who didn‚Äôt have kitchens at home, offering pre-prepared food like grilled meats, vegetables, cheese, and even heated wine. The thermopolia were found near busy urban areas like the forum and the baths, providing a quick and affordable dining experience for Romans on the go.\n\nWe visit Ostia Antica, the port city of Rome, where frescoes still depict typical menu items, such as olives, eggs, and cheese. These establishments also featured large jars of wine, grills, and sometimes patios for customers to relax while enjoying their meals. Fast food joints in ancient Rome were fun, quick, and cheap, similar to modern street food.\n\nMade possible by viewers like you.

Just like in antiquity, locals would come to these markets to buy fresh produce like chicory, beans, and figs. Roman cuisine, often simple and reliant on staples such as legumes and leafy greens, reflected the broader Mediterranean diet.\n\nFor those who couldn‚Äôt afford proper apartments, cooking at home was risky due to fire hazards and the lack of chimneys. This meant many residents of insulas‚Äîmulti-story buildings in Rome‚Äîrelied on nearby bars and eateries for their daily meals. The episode also delves into Pompeii, where paintings in a bar depict patrons enjoying wine and rolling dice, giving us a glimpse of the vibrant social life centered around these dining establishments.\n\nFish and seafood were also popular in Roman cuisine. The Romans loved octopus, squid, sardines, and more, which they often paired with garum, a fermented fish sauce that acted as a condiment much like ketchup today. Markets like the Mercato di Testaccio in modern Rome continue the ancient tradition of offering quick, flavorful meals, giving us a taste of how Romans ate thousands of years ago.</article>","contentLength":2898,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/utTF7dXcxfQ?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Neil & a Plasma Physicist Discuss the Future of Fusion Energy","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4NyRbvkmM","date":1741114490,"author":"StarTalk","guid":350,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Is fusion the future of energy and space travel? Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Paul Mecurio explore the cutting-edge science of plasma physics and fusion energy with Fatima Ebrahimi, a physicist at Princeton Plasma Physics Lab.\n\nWe begin by breaking down the basics: What is plasma, and why is it essential for fusion? From the glowing plasma balls at novelty stores to the fusion reactions powering the sun, we explore how charged particles interact and what it takes to heat plasma to fusion-level temperatures.\n\nFusion research has been ongoing for decades, but when will we finally achieve break-even energy? Fatima explains the different fusion approaches‚Äîfrom Princeton‚Äôs tokamak designs to Livermore‚Äôs laser-driven experiments‚Äîand why density, temperature, and magnetic fields play a crucial role. We discuss the major breakthroughs, the challenge of scaling fusion for commercial energy production, and whether we are truly just a decade away from a fusion-powered future.\n\nBut fusion isn‚Äôt just about energy‚Äîit‚Äôs also key to the next generation of space travel. Learn about plasma propulsion: Could this ultra-efficient rocket technology one day take us to Mars and beyond? We explore how fusion-powered spacecraft could revolutionize deep-space exploration, the challenges of decelerating at high speeds, and whether future missions will rely on in-space refueling using hydrogen from the cosmos.\n\nFinally, we take a cosmic perspective on the patience and persistence required for scientific progress. Will fusion power be ready in our lifetime? What role will AI play in accelerating breakthroughs?
