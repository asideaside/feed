In Japan this commonly means young workers required to work brutal overtime without extra pay, subjected to verbal abuse and “power harassment” from bosses. VTuber agencies worldwide have been likened to black companies when they impose similar conditions on talent. Agencies promise stardom but may demand long hours, strict obedience, and ambiguous contracts. This can be especially dangerous for female VTubers, who may face added pressures or harassment. In this context,  warning signs of an exploitative VTuber company and knowing how to protect yourself are crucial.</p><p>Originally coined in Japan, a black company is one that exploits staff much like a sweatshop: hiring young or inexperienced workers and forcing them to work excessive overtime without pay, often under bullying or harassing supervisors. Employees who try to quit can be threatened with humiliation or litigation. By extension, VTuber agencies that treat their performers as disposable labor – imposing grueling schedules, unclear rules, or punishing talent for speaking up – are sometimes called black companies by fans and insiders. These agencies may exploit the  of entertainers, offering fame in exchange for unreasonable demands. For example, some VTuber contracts bind talent  to the agency: “the talent will exclusively perform entertainment activities for the … agency” in return for support. A healthy agency might also bind talent to themselves, but black agencies use exclusivity to prevent talent from leaving or working elsewhere even when conditions deteriorate.</p><p>Globally, fans and VTubers have grown wary of agencies with these traits. Media reports have noted VTuber companies coming under fire for <em>“abrupt graduations, terminations, and suggestions that the company has stymied its talent’s attempts at potential growth opportunities”</em>. In other words, when agencies suddenly cut ties with popular performers or block them from succeeding independently, supporters cry “black company.” Paying attention to how an agency treats its current talent is key to spotting trouble.</p><p>One stark example involves , a popular Nijisanji EN VTuber. In Feb 2024, Nijisanji  Selen’s contract without warning  All her social accounts were immediately locked and her videos removed – far from the mutual “graduation” that is normal in VTuber culture. Only later did details emerge: Selen had been hospitalized for <em>“poor management and a toxic work environment”</em> at the agency. This incident sparked an unprecedented public outcry and even saw corporate sponsors dropping ties in solidarity.</p><p>Another case was  (Nijisanji EN), who was fired in March 2023 over alleged copyright and “offensive” remarks. Nijisanji claimed she violated rules, but Zaion’s supporters pointed out inconsistencies and possible misunderstandings. In both the Selen and Zaion incidents, critics noted that Nijisanji’s handling was abrupt and opaque, with no chance for talent to defend themselves. Such incidents became rallying cries: fans observed that talents were even <em>“paying out of pocket for assets and materials”</em> because the company refused to cover basic expenses. (In fact, Selen had to fund a fan-art contest prize herself when Nijisanji insisted the money come from the VTuber’s personal funds.) These stories are symptomatic of black company behavior in VTubing: shifting blame onto the talent, demanding free labor, and terminating contracts unilaterally.</p><p>Other VTuber agencies have faced criticism. New international groups like VReverie were even labeled  by former affiliates on social media. While details vary, the pattern is similar: former talents describe “toxic work environments,” withheld payments, or harassment by management. Whenever an agency consistently mistreats talent with no accountability, veteran VTubers warn others to beware.</p><h2>Challenges Unique to Female VTubers</h2><p>Female VTubers can face additional risks in exploitative settings. In many cultures, women entertainers are subject to stricter expectations and more intense scrutiny. VTubers (virtual YouTubers) are no exception. Female talents often attract “parasocial” fan attachments – fans who feel a personal, emotional connection to the streamer. While a lot of parasocial support is positive, some of it can become dangerous. In practice, this means female VTubers are more likely to be harassed online, doxxed, or have false rumors spread. Management may do little to protect them, or worse, pressure them to cater to overzealous haters (sometimes calling it ).</p><p><a href=\"https://vtubersensei.com/2024/09/15/unpacking-parasocial-relationships-in-vtuber-culture/\">Parasocial Relationships in VTubing Explained</a></p><p> (a female VTuber) was suspended in 2020 after intense online backlash: she had simply mentioned Taiwan on-stream and was flooded by nationalist harassment, leading her agency to suspend her despite her innocence. This illustrates how quickly a female VTuber’s career can be derailed by fan attacks and agency panic.</p><p>Legally, female VTubers in virtual workplaces have the same rights as in any job. Experts emphasize that harassment via an avatar or chat is still harassment. For instance, U.S. labor lawyers point out that <em>“the absence of actual touching is immaterial… [Harassing] verbal comments based on sex in an employment context is unlawful”</em>, even in virtual settings This means an agency is responsible if a talent faces gender-based harassment, cyberbullying, or worse (and can be liable if it doesn’t address it). Unfortunately, some VTuber companies have been slow to implement clear anti-harassment policies. Female VTubers may also encounter pressure to adopt certain “cute” or sexualized personas; if an agency uses coercion or unfair expectations in this regard, that is another red flag.</p><p>In summary, female VTubers must navigate both the general risks of a black-agency environment  gendered pressures. They may need stronger support networks (fellow VTubers, unions, legal advisors) to ensure they aren’t exploited or silenced.</p><h2>Red Flags and Warning Signs of an Exploitative VTuber Agency</h2><ul><li><strong>Vague or Missing Contract:</strong> No clear, written contract (or one packed with unclear terms) is a major red flag. Legitimate agencies will provide a professional talent contract. Be especially cautious of agreements that never specify pay, scope of work, or duration, or that can be terminated on a whim. (For reference, a typical VTuber “talent exclusive contract” should at least state that the talent performs exclusively for the agency, and outline mutual obligations.)</li><li> Being asked to work “for exposure” is a classic exploitative tactic. Agencies forcing long hours of streaming, content creation, or fan service without overtime pay are using black-company tactics. Watch out if you’re routinely working late nights or weekends beyond any agreed schedule, or if they require you to skip breaks or sleep in the office/studio.</li><li><strong>Verbal Abuse or Harassment:</strong> Any bullying by managers, producers, or staff is unacceptable. Black companies often use “power harassment” to control employees. If agency staff or supervisors frequently belittle talents, issue ultimatums, or pressure you relentlessly, take it very seriously.</li><li> Agencies should clearly explain how and when you’ll be paid (salary vs. revenue share vs. commissions). Beware if payment terms are never discussed or if money disappears mysteriously. Delayed or withheld earnings, unexplained “commissions,” or being told <em>“you’ll see it eventually”</em> are strong warning signs. (For example, Nijisanji reportedly blamed Selen for “delays in payment,” but artists she worked with confirmed she  paid them out of pocket – suggesting the blame was misdirection.)</li><li><strong>Ownership of Your Persona and Content:</strong> Many agencies claim ownership of the VTuber character or exclusive rights to your name and likeness. A one-sided clause that gives the company total control over your character design, brand, or even videos can be problematic. Legitimate contracts may license your character for agency use, but red flags include clauses that forbid you ever using your own avatar or name outside the company, even after you leave.</li><li><strong>Strict Exclusivity or Long Lock-in:</strong> If the agency demands an unusually long exclusive term (several years) with onerous penalties for early exit, be wary. Standard talent contracts often last 1–2 years with renewal options; anything much longer may be designed to trap you.</li><li><strong>Exploitive Auditions or Fees:</strong> Sometimes black agencies charge “management fees” up front or require you to pay for training, costumes, or equipment that should be provided. Legitimate agencies may require standard fees or deposits, but watch out if costs keep mounting or aren’t clearly justified.</li><li><strong>Sudden Termination or Blacklisting:</strong> A hallmark of a bad agency is firing talent without notice or mutual agreement. Nijisanji’s treatment of Selen – removing her from the roster  and locking her accounts overnight – is an extreme example. If an agency has a history of “graduating” or dropping VTubers abruptly (especially with public accusations or deleted content), that indicates low job security.</li><li><strong>Punishing Whistleblowers:</strong> If current or former talents speaking up about poor conditions are ostracized, threatened with NDAs, or prevented from leaving, consider that a warning. Black companies often try to silence complaints through legal threats or social pressure.</li><li><strong>Poor Reputation or Insider Reports:</strong> When researching an agency, pay attention to community chatter. If multiple VTubers or staff privately say the environment is abusive, believe it. Likewise, if the company is secretive about contract terms or refuses to put promises in writing, exercise caution.</li></ul><p>Any one of these signs doesn’t guarantee a company is exploitative, but several together strongly suggest trouble. Always trust your instincts: if something  off (like management making impossible demands or colleagues disappearing suddenly), take it seriously.</p><h2>If You’re Under Contract: Rights and Safety Measures</h2><p>If you find yourself already working for a problematic agency, there are steps you can take to protect yourself:</p><ul><li><strong>Know Your Contract and Rights:</strong> Carefully read your contract. In most places, a written employment or talent contract is legally binding; if you signed nothing, the agreement may be unenforceable. Check for exit clauses: does the contract specify a notice period, buyout options, or conditions for termination? Consult local labor laws: in many countries, forcing unpaid overtime or withholding wages violates employment law. If possible, seek legal advice from an attorney experienced in entertainment or labor law (some firms specialize in VTuber issues).</li><li> Keep meticulous records of all mistreatment or contract breaches. Note dates, times, and details whenever you are asked to work beyond agreed hours, or subjected to harassment or unfair terms. Save copies of emails, messages, and any social media posts related to your work. Take screenshots of chat logs and keep them secure. This evidence can be vital if you need to prove your case to authorities or negotiate an exit.</li><li><strong>Follow Internal Procedures (If Any):</strong> If the company has a harassment or grievance policy, use it. Some contracts or handbooks outline a process for complaints. File written reports with HR or designated contacts, keeping your own copies. Even if you suspect management won’t act, having formally complained shows you raised concerns in good faith.</li><li><strong>Seek External Advice and Support:</strong> Look for unions or associations that represent entertainers in your region. For example, actors’ unions (like SAG-AFTRA in the U.S., Equity in the U.K., or the Japanese ) may offer guidance to performers. If no specific union exists, legal aid societies or labor rights groups can sometimes help with contract disputes. Peers in the VTuber community can also advise or refer you to reputable lawyers. Don’t underestimate reaching out to a lawyer even for a consultation; specialized entertainment attorneys exist and may work on a sliding scale.</li><li> If you experience sexual harassment, threats, or stalking, treat it like any other workplace violence: inform the agency (preferably in writing) and consider contacting local law enforcement or advocacy groups. The virtual nature of VTubing doesn’t remove real-world protections: for instance, U.S. law recognizes that unwanted sexual comments or virtual touching of an avatar can count as harassment. If you fear for your physical safety or mental health, seek help immediately (hotlines, police, or medical professionals as needed).</li><li> If the situation is intolerable, plan a safe way out. Review your contract for termination clauses. If there’s a required notice period, see if you can negotiate a shorter end or a buyout. Do  simply vanish; abrupt disappearance could breach contract terms and give the company legal ammunition. Instead, consider a formal resignation letter (or request for contract termination) and try to negotiate the terms (perhaps with the aid of a lawyer). Be cautious about making public accusations before you have secured an exit, as this can provoke threats of litigation. If possible, line up next steps first: for example, negotiate with the agency to let you keep your avatar or content rights when you leave, or have a friend or family member ready to take over tasks during your transition.</li><li><strong>Prioritize Mental Health:</strong> Working for an abusive company can be stressful. Make sure to lean on friends, family, or professional counselors for emotional support. Talk with other VTubers who have left agencies or who faced similar struggles; peer support can be invaluable. Remember that no job is worth sacrificing your well-being.</li></ul><p>Throughout this process, keep in mind your basic labor rights: in many countries, withholding agreed pay, forcing illegal contracts, or subjecting someone to a hostile work environment is against the law. Government labor offices often handle wage complaints even for creative industries. Documenting all issues and seeking legal counsel will strengthen your position if you must fight a very bad contract.</p><h2>Choosing a Safe Agency or Going Independent</h2><p><a href=\"https://vtubersensei.com/2024/10/31/pros-and-cons-of-joining-a-vtuber-agency/\">Pros and Cons of joining a VTuber Agency</a></p><p>To prevent these problems in the first place, female VTubers should be very careful in selecting representation. Consider these strategies:</p><ul><li><strong>Research the Agency Thoroughly:</strong> Before auditioning or signing, dig into the agency’s reputation. Look for news articles, forum discussions, or social media about the company. Have any former talents spoken out? How did the agency handle past controversies? An agency with transparent policies and few scandals is safer.</li><li><strong>Interview Current Talent:</strong> If possible, talk privately with current or recent VTubers at the agency. Ask about working conditions, management style, and whether they feel supported. Even just observing these streamers and their content can give clues: do they seem happy and well-resourced, or burnt out and secretive?</li><li><strong>Review the Contract in Detail:</strong> Don’t sign sight-unseen. Ask for the full contract up front and read every clause. Check for things like: payment terms (when and how you get paid), required streaming hours, exclusivity, ownership of your VTuber persona, and termination conditions. If terms are unclear, demand clarification or legal review. Remember that “talent exclusive” typically means you perform only for that agency – make sure you understand what that means for side projects or collaborations.</li><li><strong>Check Policies and Support Systems:</strong> A legitimate company usually has written policies on harassment, content guidelines, and dispute resolution. When vetting an agency, ask about these policies. For example, is there a handbook or coordinator you can talk to about any problems? Are there transparent rules for how revenue is split? If the agency hesitates to answer these questions or has no formal policies, it is suspect. (By contrast, the Whitcomb Law guide suggests reviewing a company’s policies carefully to see how to report problems– use this approach for any talent agreement.)</li><li> Legitimate VTuber agencies often advertise professional services (talent training, marketing support, tech help, merchandise production, etc.). They should present themselves with a proper business presence: a clear website, public contact info, and reasonable expectations. Avoid agencies that seem amateurish (e.g. only a social media page, no official domain, no way to contact easily) or that behave unprofessionally during your application process (e.g. they fail to respond to emails, or they pressure you to join immediately).</li><li> Remember that being an agency talent is not your only option. Some VTubers succeed independently or through community networks. If you go solo, be prepared to handle everything yourself (streaming setup, brand design, self-promotion). Building an audience organically takes time, so you might start as independent and join an agency later once you have more leverage. Keep backup plans: save money for emergencies, and never rely on an agency as your only source of support.</li><li> Whenever possible, treat your VTuber persona as your intellectual property. For instance, retain authorship of your character design or use independent servers for streaming. If you work as an independent contractor, consider forming a small company or having a legal agreement that grants you ownership of your content. This way, if a bad agency tries to claim your VTuber identity, you can contest it.</li></ul><p>Finally, trust your instincts. If an agency’s pitch sounds  good to be true, or if early interactions leave you uneasy (e.g. they pry into personal matters, insist on immediate commitment, or make unreasonable demands during audition), they’re likely unsafe. Female VTubers should be especially careful about agencies that overemphasize “image” or personal sacrifice. Agencies exist to  your career, not to exploit your work or well-being.</p><p><a href=\"https://vtubersensei.com/2025/05/25/the-rise-of-indie-vtubers-amid-corporate-agency-turmoil/\">The Rise of Indie Vtubers amidst Corporate Turmoil</a></p><h2>Empowering Yourself and Others</h2><p>By educating yourself on what a black-company environment looks like, you can avoid the worst traps. Always read any contract fully and keep records of all interactions. Look for solid references and don’t hesitate to negotiate or say no to clauses you find unfair. Remember that as a performer, you have rights: you can consult a lawyer, report illegal labor practices to authorities, and in many places even form or join a union. Sharing information with other VTubers creates a community defense – if you hear friends discussing a bad agency, take it seriously and spread the word to warn others (within safe legal limits).</p><p>The VTuber industry is still young and evolving, and female performers should not have to endure abuse to succeed. By spotting warning signs early, documenting any mistreatment, and speaking up for proper contracts and safe workplaces, you protect yourself and pave the way for a healthier community. Trustworthy agencies recognize that supporting their talent’s safety and creativity is the only way to thrive. If every VTuber – especially women, who often carry extra burdens – stands together and demands fair treatment, exploitative “black” practices will become harder to ignore. Your skills and creativity deserve respect, compensation, and a positive work environment. If an agency won’t give that, better to walk away than sacrifice yourself for someone else’s profit.</p>","contentLength":19570,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://vtubersensei.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/former-hololive-talent-kiryu-coco.jpg?w=640","enclosureMime":"text/html","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"ANYCOLOR FY2025: Revenue Surge and Declining NIJISANJI EN Prospects","url":"https://vtubersensei.com/2025/06/11/anycolor-fy2025-revenue-surge-and-declining-nijisanji-en-prospects/","date":1749628127,"author":"Thomas Toblu","guid":409,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In the fiscal year ending April 30, 2025 (FY2025.4), ANYCOLOR, Inc. delivered strong overall growth, setting new records in revenue, operating profit, and net profit, driven primarily by its Commerce and Event segments.

Some fans are just casual viewers, but the  (“gachi-koi,” “unicorns,” etc.) make or break a VTuber’s career. These super-devoted fans <em>invest time, money, and emotion</em> in you . Understanding who they are (and who casual viewers are) is the first step.</p><p>A  is made of viewers who treat your avatar and persona almost like a beloved idol. They form  – one-sided bonds where fans feel close to you even though you only interact through the screen.. Hardcore fans come in flavors:  (heavy “in-love” supporters) and  fans.

Both types are highly parasocial – they feel like your best friends (or lovers), even though you only know them through the stream .</p><p>In short, a hardcore audience is . They will subscribe, join paid memberships, buy merch, draw fan art, organize Discord communities, and defend you online. Casual viewers might stop by for a stream or two, but hardcore fans <strong>stick around and actively fuel your channel</strong>. </p><p>As VTuber Sensei puts it, </p><blockquote><p>“Casual fans might stop by… but hardcore fans are the ones who stick around and invest their time, money, and emotional energy”. </p></blockquote><p>Those hardcore fans keep you <strong>relevant in a crowded market</strong>, and VTubers who nurture them enjoy long-term success even when casual viewership dips.</p><h2>Idol Culture and VTuber Fandom</h2><p>VTubers didn’t emerge in a vacuum – they grew from , and that cultural heritage shapes fandom expectations. In J-pop idol culture, fans often expect their idols to stay “pure,” forming one-sided romantic feelings and even demanding a “no-dating” image. VTubing inherited this model in some ways. Like traditional idols, VTubers present carefully crafted personas: colorful avatars and consistent characters that never break character in public. This  approach lets fans project feelings onto you. Parasocial relationships are at the heart of this: viewers feel a unique closeness because they can chat with you live, send donations, and even see your avatar react in real time . This direct interaction takes idol culture’s “Idol Journey” – where fans support an idol’s growth – and turbocharges it with technology.</p><p>Because of this idol influence, many VTuber fans come with <strong>very specific expectations</strong>. They want you to be cute, supportive, and accessible, but also mysterious. They crave : they’ll remember your catchphrases, avatar details, inside jokes – and expect the same personality each time. This can lead to pressure: some hardcore fans (especially unicorns) even  that their fave VTuber not interact with male streamers, mirroring old idol rules . On the positive side, idol culture also means fans will go all-out supporting you – buying albums (read: music CDs), concert tickets (3D live events), and tons of merch. The Hololive 3D live concerts are a perfect example: fans passionately cheer and spend just like idol concert-goers.</p><p>Idol culture’s key legacy is . Fans develop an “Idol Journey” bond: they follow you from debut onward, cheering as you improve (level up your streaming, celebrate milestones, drop music, etc.). The more you lean into that persona-driven, interactive style, the more you encourage that idol-like loyalty. As Vtuber Sensei notes, VTubers and idols share a powerful phenomenon: a “special and strong parasocial relationship” where fans feel personally connected to the avatar. This closeness fuels both the emotional satisfaction of fans and their willingness to  on you (time, money, clout).</p><h2>Why Hardcore Fans Matter: Economics and Emotion</h2><p>Hardcore fans are literally the  of a VTuber’s career – financially and emotionally. Economically, the VTuber world thrives on fan spending. VTuber streams only bring in modest ad revenue unless you’re huge, so most income comes from fans: superchats/donations, memberships, sponsorships, merch, and live events Hardcore fans pay for all of it. They’ll subscribe or join multiple tiers of memberships (often 5$–30$/month) because it’s like joining your “fan club” – and 70–80% of that is your profit. They’ll also drop big Super Chats (with YouTube taking 30%), send tips, and buy merchandise even at high prices. In fact, VTubers make up <strong>seven of the top ten most Superchatted channels</strong> on YouTube, showing how aggressively fans tip their favorites. According to industry data, merchandising is exploding: Cover Corp (Hololive’s parent) saw nearly <strong>80% growth in merch sales</strong> in one quarter, thanks to fans buying everything from official card games to limited-edition hoodies. (Those fans are hardcore!)</p><p>Even beyond money, hardcore fans are an emotional pillar. They form communities – Discord servers, Reddit groups, fan art boards – that keep your brand alive between streams. They constantly share clips, hype up events, and defend you from trolls. Psychologically, VTubers offer fans . Many viewers are socially isolated young men; watching your stream gives them a sense of companionship and a “safe space” to interact. When you thank someone by name, laugh at their jokes, or remember their pet’s name, it fulfills a real human need. Hardcore fans often report feeling happier and less lonely after watching their favorite VTuber. This emotional bond makes them fiercely protective: they’ll rally behind you during tough times and celebrate your victories as their own.</p><p>Crucially, VTubers who <strong>nurture hardcore fans tend to thrive long-term</strong>. These fans keep watching and supporting even if algorithms change or casual viewer counts dip. </p><blockquote><p>“The loyalty these hardcore fans provide is essential to the long-term success of any VTuber”. </p></blockquote><p>In lean times, these die-hards are the ones still clicking “live,” still dropping the odd Super Chat, still repping your merch. They basically pay your bills – or at least bankroll the majority of your income. Vtuber Sensei bluntly advises: <strong>cherish those hardcore fans</strong>, because “they will carry you through your VTubing journey”.</p><h2>Casual vs Hardcore Viewers: How They Impact Your Channel</h2><p>Not all viewers are equal. Understanding  vs.  is key to growing and sustaining your community:</p><ul><li> They catch a stream when they can, maybe watch an interesting game, or tune in during a big event or collaboration. They rarely stick around for the full stream and will drop off early if something better comes up. They might follow your highlights on YouTube or social media, but they don’t tune in regularly. At best, some casual fans will subscribe or join the lowest membership tier <em>only to get a few extra perks</em>, but they  or buy merch. These viewers boost your raw view count, but they’re unlikely to leave comments, tip a lot, or build community. You can’t rely on casuals for steady revenue – in fact, Vtuber Sensei notes you “rarely [make] a living off” a purely casual audience unless you have the backing of a big agency.</li><li> A special subset of casuals – they  appear for big events (like collabs or announcements) and vanish otherwise. They might contribute a like but never engage deeply or donate. These give spikes in viewership statistics, but don’t build your core fanbase.</li><li><strong>Hardcore (High-Value) Viewers:</strong> These are the Gachikoi and Unicorns we described. They watch every stream they can, often for hours on end. They engage in chat, donate superchats on occasion, and subscribe to memberships (sometimes multiple tiers). They also help set trends – streaming cons told by clips and fan works. In forums and social media, they praise you and defend you if someone trolls you. These fans <strong>directly boost important metrics</strong>: high concurrent viewer counts, longer average watch times, and active chat logs help with platform algorithms. In short, hardcore fans are far more  per person than casuals.</li></ul><p>The impact on your channel shows up in two ways:</p><ul><li> Casuals give you random spikes, but hardcore viewers give you consistency. A stream with mostly hardcore fans might have a smaller peak, but steady viewership and high engagement (like chat activity or superchats throughout). This consistent support makes your channel look healthier to platforms. Over time, hardcore fans also help you trend – they share clips and fan content, bringing in new eyes.</li><li> Hardcore fans pay for memberships, merch, and donations, whereas casuals rarely do. For example, a VTuber membership (fan club) can cost the equivalent of $5–$30 a month, which adds up when dozens or hundreds of hardcore fans join. Merchandise sales (T-shirts, keychains, plushies with your avatar) only happen when fans are  in you. Casuals might buy a sticker, but hardcore fans will buy  you release. A strong core of super-fans thus keeps the bank account healthy even if occasional viewers trickle.</li></ul><p>In short: <strong>casual viewers grow numbers; hardcore fans grow longevity</strong>. A massive but shallow audience can flame out; a modest but dedicated fanbase can sustain a career </p><h2>Hololive English Case Studies</h2><p>Hololive English (HoloEN) provides real-world examples of how cultivating a hardcore audience pays off. The first generation (Gawr Gura, Mori Calliope, Takanashi Kiara, Ninomae Ina’nis, Watson Amelia) each built fiercely loyal followings with distinct brands.</p><ul><li> Gura leaned into her shark-theme and cheeky personality, focusing on gaming and singing streams. Fans (her self-named “Chumbuds” and “Shrimps”) adopted her catchphrases, fan art, and even fan-made songs. She hit millions of subs in record time, illustrating how a clear niche plus consistent persona attracts both casual viewers  hardcore fans. The  around Gura (shark loli, memes) spread virally on Twitter/Reddit, showing hardcore fan involvement.</li><li><strong>Mori Calliope (Dead Beats):</strong> As Hololive’s musical emcee, Mori focused on original music. Her fans eagerly bought her albums and merch whenever released, treating each song drop like an idol single. Calliope’s emphasis on songwriting and character lore gave fans deep content to engage with. Her dedicated music supporters famously streamed her songs en masse (some hits reached millions of views in hours), exemplifying how tailored content and community hype fuel success.</li></ul><p>Cover Corp’s financial reports reflect this engagement. For example, Cover reported a <strong>~50% revenue jump in one quarter</strong>, attributing much of it to new VTuber debuts (bringing new fanbases) and <strong>merch sales up nearly 80%</strong> thanks to fan demand. These numbers wouldn’t exist without super-fans snapping up products and promoting the brand.</p><p><em>(Note: Hololive is a prime example of corporate strategy. But many independent female VTubers apply the same principles. Nimi Nightmare, for instance with a majority of male fans, leans heavily on GFE interaction to nurture those fans. Independent VTubers often rely even more on core fans since they lack corporate marketing, so they mirror these idol tactics in how they engage and brand themselves.)</em></p><h2>Actionable Strategies: Attracting and Nurturing Your Core Fans</h2><p>Building a hardcore audience takes deliberate effort. Here are concrete steps VTubers can use to attract, retain, and grow a loyal fanbase, rooted in community-proven tactics:</p><ul><li><strong>Craft a Clear Persona &amp; Niche:</strong> Know who you are and stick to it. Successful VTubers have a <strong>consistent character and theme</strong>. Maybe you’re the gentle ASMR storyteller, the over-the-top gamer, or the soothing 2D musician. Pick what makes you unique.  Gawr Gura focused on her shark motif and love of games/music, and that clear branding helped her fans “get” her instantly. Your hardcore fans will rally around whatever distinctive trait or niche you own.</li><li><strong>Be Authentic and Responsive (Parasocial Bonding):</strong> Hardcore fans thrive on feeling close to you. During streams, , react to comments, and remember repeated viewers <a href=\"https://vtubersensei.com/2024/09/26/creating-your-gfe-persona-tips-for-vtubers/#:~:text=,their%20loyalty%20to%20your%20brand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"></a>. Even small gestures make a big difference: a quick shoutout to “Suzuki-san” or remembering a regular viewer’s birthday makes them feel . Fans often say this personal touch is what makes them tune in every time. In short, treat your chat as friends. Be warm, caring, or playful – whatever fits your persona – and keep it consistent. One useful tactic is membership- or subscriber-only streams: e.g. a Q&amp;A for subs or a private Discord hangout. This keeps interactions  for your core fans, deepening the bond without requiring 1-on-1 chats with every fan (setting a healthy boundary).</li><li> Ironically, maintaining  mystery can make fans appreciate you more. You want to be engaging , but you don’t have to be on-call 24/7. Politely manage messages/DMs: for instance, direct fans to fan servers or use bots to handle routine stuff. This way, you stay safe from harassment but also make your live appearances feel more special. VTuber Sensei reminds creators to “set boundaries—both in what you share and how you respond to over-familiar fans”. Clear rules (e.g. no private social media DMs, no sharing personal info) protect you and remind fans that interactions happen mostly  on stream. This actually preserves the idol aura many fans expect.</li><li> Keep your visuals and voice . Use the same avatar style and catchphrases on YouTube, Twitter, TikTok, etc. Hardcore fans notice if your persona wavers. If you’re a gentle story-teller, keep that vibe even on Instagram. If you’re the goofy gamer, meme-hard on Twitter too. Consistency helps fans feel at home and spreads your identity: for example, Gura’s shark theme and Mori’s oni horns are instantly recognizable and used in memes and fan art. Also use platform features: update your Twitch panels with your logo colors, have a unique clap-emote on YouTube, etc. All this solidifies your brand and keeps fans engaged.</li><li><strong>Engage in Fan Communities:</strong> Join (or start) Discords, subreddits, Twitter hashtags, etc. Fan communities often flourish on their own, but your presence (even silently reading or occasionally dropping a message) shows you care. Fanart channels, meme channels, translation channels – encourage them. When fans create fan art or fan songs, shout them out or react on stream. For example, when Mori’s fanmade music videos popped up, she publicly thanked the creators, which only fueled more creativity. This user-generated content keeps your fandom active. Also, consider contests or streaming games with fan-donated ideas. This co-creation makes fans feel invested in  success.</li><li> Offer memberships and merch that hardcore fans love. Create  with genuine perks: special emotes, access to a private Discord voice chat on stream nights, or an exclusive monthly hangout stream . Make the perks feel like “joining your inner circle.” For merch, start with simple things fans can wear or display: T-shirts, hoodies, phone cases, stickers with your avatar or catchphrase. Then consider big-ticket items: plushies, figures, or artwork prints. Limited drops and themed bundles (e.g. “First Anniversary Set” or “Game Tournament Hoodies”) create excitement. Hardcore fans buy merchandise to  and feel closer to you <a href=\"https://vtubersensei.com/2024/09/12/strategies-for-building-a-strong-and-recognizable-personal-vtuber-brand/#:~:text=,them%20feel%20heard%20and%20valued\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">67</a><a href=\"https://vtubersensei.com/2025/01/05/how-to-create-successful-vtuber-merch/#:~:text=,forefront%20of%20your%20audience%E2%80%99s%20mind\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">68</a>. (Sales of merch are a  stream because once it’s made, fans buy repeatedly.)</li><li><strong>Exclusive &amp; Behind-the-Scenes Content:</strong> Hardcore fans crave anything . This can be easy to implement. Do occasional  where you maybe try a new project or just hang out in low-key chats. Release behind-the-scenes clips on Patreon or YouTube membership only – things like your VTuber rig setup, avatar design process, or blooper reels. The feeling of an “inner circle” is priceless to fans. It says, “You’re more than a number; you’re a supporter who gets special access.” VTuber Sensei recommends, “offer your hardcore fans something special, like exclusive streams… or behind-the-scenes content. Make them feel like part of an inner circle”.</li><li> In the VTuber world, collabs can boost exposure. But to keep hardcore fans happy, pick your collabs . Many unicorn fans don’t like collabs with male streamers – so if that’s your audience, you might want to prioritize all-female collabs or VTuber-only collabs. (Alternatively, handle it on stream: if you do a mixed-gender collab, reassure fans it’s just professional content and you’re not changing your persona. But expect a hit in revenue.) Likewise, collaborating with fans (fan artists, voice actors) can be a fun way to reward community members. But don’t spread collabs too thin – fans sometimes feel betrayed if you suddenly stream with a random creator unrelated to your theme. Balance broadening your network with keeping your core brand.</li><li> Hardcore fans often keep calendars to watch  streams. Maintaining a <strong>consistent streaming schedule</strong> helps them plan around your content. If fans know you’re live every Tuesday/Friday at 7pm, they’ll regularly show up. Sudden cancellations or long hiatuses can lose momentum. Of course, life happens – but give as much notice as possible and perhaps do a shorter backup stream or a quick chat so they aren’t left hanging.</li><li> Ultimately, none of the above matters if the content doesn’t . Play games or do activities you genuinely enjoy (this keeps energy up), but also pay attention to what hardcore fans love: maybe chatty “Just Chatting” nights for bonding, or themed streams (karaoke nights, ASMR, storytelling, etc.) that fit your character. Analyze which streams get the most engagement or donations and do more of those. Variety is good, but a core identity (idol, artist, gamer, etc.) is key. High production values (good audio, visuals) also signal you care – and in our avatars, even minor improvements (like a cool new wave effect when someone subs) can thrill fans.</li><li><strong>Handle Shoppers (Gachikoi) and Shippers Carefully:</strong> Some hardcore fans (gachikoi) might act overly possessive, shipping you with someone or demanding personal attention. Engage gently: thank them for support, but keep public comments professional. If a fan tries to force personal drama (“Why aren’t you dating so-and-so?”), it’s okay to politely ignore or set boundary. High-conflict drama can upset other fans, so manage it swiftly. However, don’t alienate them completely – they still spend a lot on you. Redirect their passion: for example, start a fan art contest instead of a “ship” rumor.</li><li><strong>Embrace the Parasocial (But Carefully):</strong> Remember, hardcore fans  feeling they have a personal connection. Use parasocial techniques: use warm language like a friend, share “personal” stories through your character (e.g. funny pet anecdotes, favorite foods), even role-play “field trips.” Just keep real personal details vague to maintain healthy boundaries. For example, talk about your day as if you’re with them “late night studying” or “cooking dinner.” This closeness makes fans feel they truly know you, boosting loyalty. But at the same time, don’t pretend too realistically – maintain character cues so fans remember it’s an avatar. It’s a balancing act between fantasy and authenticity.</li><li><strong>Marketing Savvy (VTuber Marketing):</strong> Even as a VTuber, some marketing thinking helps. Use SEO keywords in your video titles (“VTuber audience,” “parasocial relationship,” etc.) if that’s part of your strategy. But more importantly, engage fans on social media like a brand: post clips on TikTok or Twitter, run polls (“What song should I cover next?”), and use fan-friendly hashtags. Announce merch or events with tease images. Some VTubers create countdowns or small puzzles leading up to big streams – these gamify your content. All these strategies are part of VTuber marketing: building hype and staying top-of-mind for your core fans. As one VTuber guide notes, “If your target audience is fans who want more than just casual chats, you’ll use your persona and consistent messaging to attract them”.</li><li> Show appreciation. Thank your member sub-hype trains on stream, post a “thank you” tweet after hitting a goal, or send a fan a surprise gift (like a hand-signed art print) as a raffle prize. When fans feel recognized, they dig in even deeper. Many VTubers hold loyalty badges (e.g. “You’ve been a member for 6 months!”) or special titles for long-time followers. These small rewards keep hardcore fans around.</li></ul><h2>The Takeaway: Make Hardcore Fans Your Foundation</h2><p>In the fast-moving VTuber world, chasing every trend or viewer gimmick leads nowhere. The  are your foundation. They pay the bills, build the hype, and emotionally support you. Idol culture taught us that a passionate dedicated fanbase can turn a new face into a superstar. VTubers just have to tap into that by providing consistent, authentic content and fostering real connections.</p><p>As VTuber Sensei puts it: </p><blockquote><p><em>“Hardcore fans are the backbone of any successful VTuber brand. They buy your merch, show up to streams no matter what, and spread the word about you”</em>. </p></blockquote><p>In other words, treat them like VIPs. Offer them exclusives, involve them in your journey, and always stay true to the persona they love. If you do that, you’ll find those casual lurkers may slowly transform into your next super-fans.</p><p>Remember: a parasocial relationship might only be “one-sided,” but its rewards can be very real. Your hardcore audience isn’t just a number on a dashboard – they’re a community that gives  to your VTuber career. So engage honestly, brand smartly, and always appreciate the Chumbuds, Shrimps, and Nincompees by name. They’ll repay you with loyalty, revenue, and the joy of watching your character thrive.</p>","contentLength":21891,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://vtubersensei.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/viewer-spectrum.png","enclosureMime":"text/html","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The Rise of Indie VTubers Amid Corporate Agency Turmoil","url":"https://vtubersensei.com/2025/05/25/the-rise-of-indie-vtubers-amid-corporate-agency-turmoil/","date":1748199209,"author":"Thomas Toblu","guid":340,"unread":true,"content":"<p>The VTubing phenomenon has exploded from a niche Asian curiosity into a global streaming powerhouse over the past decade.

Japan’s Cover Corp launched  in 2017, quickly building a stable of pro talent. Virtually at the same time, ANYCOLOR (then Ichikara) debuted , and Western-oriented agencies like  appeared by 2020. By 2023 the two largest agencies alone boasted staggering followings –  subscribers for NIJISANJI and  for Hololive (<a href=\"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/heres-why-anycolor-stock-slid-over-5-in-one-day-3337094#:~:text=Collectively%2C%20Nijisanji%E2%80%99s%20VTubers%20have%20over,60%20million%20followers%20on%20Youtube\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">investing.com</a>).

Even so, totals remain far higher than pre-pandemic; and VTubers continue to occupy a growing share of overall streaming. According to Stream Hatchet, VTubers now command <strong>3.7% of live-stream viewership</strong> (up 10× from five years earlier) (). This mainstreaming means big brand partnerships and mainstream media exposure for VTubers – but it also invites scrutiny of the corporate models behind them.</p><h2>Corporate vs. Independent VTubing: Pros and Cons</h2><p>In the VTuber world today there are : corporate (or “agency”) talents vs. independent (or “indie”) creators. Each has distinct advantages and drawbacks:</p><ul><li><strong>Agency (Corporate) VTuber</strong>: Signing with a talent agency like Hololive, NIJISANJI, or VShojo often grants an enormous head start. Agencies provide high-end resources <em>“to elevate your content”</em>: pro avatar design, technical support, and marketing  (<a href=\"https://vtubersensei.com/2024/10/31/pros-and-cons-of-joining-a-vtuber-agency/#:~:text=Access%20to%20Professional%20Resources\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">vtubersensei.com</a><a href=\"https://vtubersensei.com/2024/10/31/pros-and-cons-of-joining-a-vtuber-agency/#:~:text=Exposure%20and%20Audience%20Growth\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">)</a>. Talents get custom 2D/3D models crafted by experienced artists, polished overlays, editors, and even direction for content (<a href=\"https://vtubersensei.com/2024/10/31/pros-and-cons-of-joining-a-vtuber-agency/#:~:text=Exposure%20and%20Audience%20Growth\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">vtubersensei.com</a>). Importantly, agencies also bring instant exposure: a slot in a top agency means your debut is introduced to an existing fanbase, and you’ll frequently collab with star classmates. Agencies handle promotion, sponsorships, and cross-channel events that an independent could never engineer alone <a href=\"https://vtubersensei.com/2024/10/31/pros-and-cons-of-joining-a-vtuber-agency/#:~:text=Exposure%20and%20Audience%20Growth\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">(</a><a href=\"https://vtubersensei.com/2024/10/31/pros-and-cons-of-joining-a-vtuber-agency/#:~:text=Collaboration%20Opportunities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">vtubersensei.com</a>). In short, joining a well-known agency can give a <strong>huge jump in audience and production quality</strong> with far less effort on the part of the VTuber (<a href=\"https://vtubersensei.com/2024/10/31/pros-and-cons-of-joining-a-vtuber-agency/#:~:text=Exposure%20and%20Audience%20Growth\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">vtubersensei.com</a>).</li><li>: All that support comes at a price. VTubers in agencies typically sign <strong>long-term, exclusive contracts</strong> with many restrictions. They often lose creative control: certain games or topics might be off-limits, and even collaborations or sponsorships may need agency approval (<a href=\"https://vtubersensei.com/2024/10/31/pros-and-cons-of-joining-a-vtuber-agency/#:~:text=Loss%20of%20Creative%20Control\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">vtubersensei.com</a>). Agencies may enforce strict quotas (e.g. required streaming hours), and because the persona/avatar is usually , leaving the company often means abandoning that identity (<a href=\"https://vtubersensei.com/2024/10/31/pros-and-cons-of-joining-a-vtuber-agency/#:~:text=Contractual%20Obligations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">vtubersensei.com</a>). In practice, this means if a talent parts ways, they typically cannot take their character or channel with them – the IP stays with the company. Additionally, agencies take a share of revenue (sometimes 30–50% or more) (<a href=\"https://vtubersensei.com/2024/10/31/pros-and-cons-of-joining-a-vtuber-agency/#:~:text=Revenue%20Sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">vtubersensei.com</a>), meaning VTubers earn  than they would independently. Some also report that agencies’ bureaucratic structures and red tape can slow things down – for example, one journalist noted complaints of  and <em>“limited creative freedom”</em> among Hololive staff (<a href=\"https://virtualsweet.jp/the-unstable-situation-of-hololive/#:~:text=the%20unstable%20situation%20of%20hololive,Some%20talents%20have\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">virtualsweet.jp</a>).</li><li>: Going solo gives a VTuber full autonomy. An indie can stream any content they want, manage their own schedule, and keep essentially  (minus platform fees) (<a href=\"https://vtubersensei.com/2024/10/31/pros-and-cons-of-joining-a-vtuber-agency/#:~:text=Revenue%20Sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">vtubersensei.com</a>). There are no corporate bosses or contracts limiting what you say or do, and you own all the IP for your character. Indies can pivot quickly or try unconventional ideas without waiting for approval. In many cases, this means greater creative satisfaction and control. For example, ex-agency talents have turned loose outside the corporate structure and invented new personas or content approaches that wouldn’t have been allowed on a corporate stream (<a href=\"https://hololivetoday.com/op-eds-list/corporate-to-indie-dynamic-between-models#:~:text=factors%20before%20making%20the%20leap,to%20those%20starting%20from%20scratch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hololivetoday.com</a><a href=\"https://www.jaxon.gg/is-ceres-fauna-returning-as-vtuber-lemonleaf/#:~:text=Fans%20noticed%20that%20LemonLeaf%E2%80%99s%20YouTube,vtuber%20is%20now%20rebranding%20herself\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">)(jaxon.gg</a>). In theory, indies have <em>“a higher degree of freedom”</em> (as one analysis notes) and can connect more personally with fans as individual creators (<a href=\"https://www.news.viverse.com/post/top-indie-vtubers#:~:text=Like%20freelancers%2C%20Kojinzei%20VTubers%20enjoy,vibrant%20interactions%20and%20stronger%20loyalty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">news.viverse.com</a>).</li><li>: Of course, independents must handle . They must finance their own avatar and studio costs, learn editing and marketing, and build audiences from scratch (or rely on an existing fanbase). Without an agency team, technical glitches or business negotiations can fall entirely on the VTuber’s shoulders. Indies also often lack consistent production: many solo creators upload less frequently and may experience burnout when handling all roles. A common metaphor is that agency VTubers are like “office workers” with support staff, whereas indies are solo entrepreneurs or artists (<a href=\"https://www.news.viverse.com/post/top-indie-vtubers#:~:text=Like%20freelancers%2C%20Kojinzei%20VTubers%20enjoy,vibrant%20interactions%20and%20stronger%20loyalty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">news.viverse.com</a>). Crucially, <strong>breaking through as a completely new indie creator is very difficult</strong>. The vast majority of indie VTubers remain small or part-time; only a very few achieve large-scale success. This “winner-take-all” effect means that while headline success stories (often ex-agency talents) grab the limelight,  indies build modest channels that never rival agency peers. As one analysis points out, the roughly one-third market share held by indies is <strong>“likely accounted [for] by a select group of successful indies,”</strong> implying that the average independent creator has a tiny slice (<a href=\"https://hololivetoday.com/op-eds-list/corporate-to-indie-dynamic-between-models#:~:text=just%20one%20tier%20below,select%20group%20of%20successful%20indies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hololivetoday.com</a>).</li></ul><p>In summary, agencies offer a  with expensive production and built-in fans (<a href=\"https://vtubersensei.com/2024/10/31/pros-and-cons-of-joining-a-vtuber-agency/#:~:text=Access%20to%20Professional%20Resources\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">vtubersensei.com</a><a href=\"https://vtubersensei.com/2024/10/31/pros-and-cons-of-joining-a-vtuber-agency/#:~:text=Exposure%20and%20Audience%20Growth\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">)</a>, but at the cost of autonomy and revenue share<a href=\"https://vtubersensei.com/2024/10/31/pros-and-cons-of-joining-a-vtuber-agency/#:~:text=Revenue%20Sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">(vtubersensei.com</a>). Independent VTubers sacrifice that safety net for creative freedom and profit potential, but they face a steep climb to grow an audience on their own. The choice depends on a talent’s priorities: many aspiring VTubers join agencies for support, while others prize the indie path to keep their character and vision fully theirs (<a href=\"https://vtubersensei.com/2024/10/31/pros-and-cons-of-joining-a-vtuber-agency/#:~:text=Should%20You%20Join%20an%20Agency%3F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">vtubersensei.com</a>).</p><h2>Major Graduations and Exits</h2><p>In recent years, <strong>several high-profile VTubers have “graduated” or left their agencies</strong>, dramatically illustrating the tension between corporate control and personal freedom. These exits have drawn enormous fan attention and reshaped the scene. Below are some key examples:</p><ul><li>: In late 2024, Hololive English’s star  announced she would graduate (leave Hololive) effective January 3, 2025. Fauna, one of the most-watched English talents, surprisingly cited <em>“differences in opinions with management”</em> as her reason (<a href=\"https://vchavcha.com/en/virtual-news/hololive-chloe-and-fauna-graduate/#:~:text=On%20December%201%2C%20Hololive%20EN%E2%80%99s,graduation%20as%20her%20path%20forward\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">vchavcha.com</a>). Hololive’s official statement even explicitly used the term “Graduation” (implying a permanent departure in contrast to “Affiliation”). Many saw this as hinting at creative disagreements or stress. Within hours of her final Hololive stream, eagle-eyed fans noticed Fauna’s original persona “LemonLeaf” returning to activity: her YouTube channel rebranded as  the day after her graduation (<a href=\"https://www.jaxon.gg/is-ceres-fauna-returning-as-vtuber-lemonleaf/#:~:text=Vtuber%20LemonLeaf%20returned%20from%20her,rebranding%20herself%20as%20Nimi%20Nightmare\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">jaxon.gg</a>) (<a href=\"https://virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki/Nimi_Nightmare#:~:text=In%20August%202024%2C%20the%20Nimi,shortly%20after%20achieving%20300%2C000%20subscribers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">virtualyoutuber.fandom.com</a>). Nimi Nightmare debuted Jan 17, 2025 – and blew past 300K subs almost immediately. In fact, her growth was meteoric: by Jan 18 she had 400K subs and by Jan 23 reached <a href=\"https://virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki/Nimi_Nightmare#:~:text=On%2018%20January%2C%20she%20reached,400%2C000%20YouTube%20subscribers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">(virtualyoutuber.fandom.com</a>). By late April 2025 she hit  subscribers, with debut streams peaking over 90,000 viewers (<a href=\"https://virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki/Nimi_Nightmare#:~:text=On%2022%20April%2C%20she%20debuted,6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">virtualyoutuber.fandom.com</a>). This spectacular surge shows Fauna’s fans loyally following her to indie status. (Notably, Fauna also announced she’d make all her past membership content free after graduation (<a href=\"https://vchavcha.com/en/virtual-news/hololive-chloe-and-fauna-graduate/#:~:text=On%20December%201%2C%20Hololive%20EN%E2%80%99s,graduation%20as%20her%20path%20forward\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">vchavcha.com</a>) – a sign she wanted a fresh start.)</li><li><strong>Selen Tatsuki (NIJISANJI EN)</strong>: Selen’s exit from ANYCOLOR’s English branch in January 2024 caused an uproar. The sudden  of Selen’s contract (not a normal graduation) was officially attributed to “behavior unbecoming” (later rumors blamed social media incidents), but it <em>happened just as she took a medical break</em>, which sparked outrage. Fans and VTubers reacted with , accusing Nijisanji of mistreating talent (<a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/24065311/vtuber-selen-tatsuki-nijisanji-termination-dokibird#:~:text=But%20while%20agencies%20have%20been,that%20hasn%E2%80%99t%20been%20seen%20before\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">polygon.com</a>). ANYCOLOR’s CEO later apologized for communication failures, but the damage to trust was palpable. Importantly, Selen immediately revived as indie persona: . In Feb 2024 she relaunched as Dokibird, and the fan response was staggering. On Feb 5, 2024, her YouTube subs jumped from ~9K to over , and one day later she hit <a href=\"https://virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki/Dokibird#:~:text=On%205%20February%2C%20following%20a,will%20stream%20on%20Twitch%20occasionally\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> (virtualyoutuber.fandom.com</a>). Her debut stream on Feb 7 peaked at ~127,000 concurrent viewers. By Feb 13 she reached  subs – adding nearly  followers in 8 days (<a href=\"https://virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki/Dokibird#:~:text=On%208%20February%2C%20shortly%20after,having%20no%20streams%20after%20redebut\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">virtualyoutuber.fandom.com</a>). By mid-March she was over 600K subs and hosting huge charity streams. In short, Selen/Dokibird’s meteoric indie success – and the vitriol aimed at ANYCOLOR over her firing – became a turning point. Many in the community lamented that a beloved VTuber was driven out by rigid corporate rules, yet immediately flourished independently (<a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/24065311/vtuber-selen-tatsuki-nijisanji-termination-dokibird#:~:text=But%20while%20agencies%20have%20been,that%20hasn%E2%80%99t%20been%20seen%20before\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">polygon.com</a><a href=\"https://virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki/Dokibird#:~:text=On%205%20February%2C%20following%20a,will%20stream%20on%20Twitch%20occasionally\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> (virtualyoutuber.fandom.com</a>).</li><li><strong>Pomu Rainpuff (NIJISANJI EN)</strong>: Pomu was an original member of Nijisanji EN’s first generation . By August 2023 she had amassed over  on YouTube (<a href=\"https://www.jaxon.gg/are-maid-mint-and-pomu-rainpuff-the-same-person/#:~:text=In%20May%202021%2C%20a%20suspiciously,her%20a%20star%20for%20Nijisanji\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">jaxon.gg</a>) and seemed destined for big stardom. Then, in January 2024, Pomu announced a sudden graduation from Nijisanji EN citing burnout and . The news shocked fans; Pomu herself lamented that she had to turn down exciting projects due to agency constraints (though she said little publicly). Nearly three months later, in April 2024, Pomu re-emerged – but this time as her original indie avatar “Mint Fantôme (Maid Mint)”. As an indie, she immediately drew her old fans: within weeks she reached around <a href=\"https://www.jaxon.gg/are-maid-mint-and-pomu-rainpuff-the-same-person/#:~:text=Things%20would%20be%20silent%20for,every%20change%20of%20character%20comes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">(jaxon.gg</a>), and by April 2025 she had about  subscribers (her numbers are still growing) (<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-i-built-youtube-career-as-anime-character-virtual-influencer-2025-4#:~:text=,pathway%20into%20the%20entertainment%20industry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">businessinsider.com</a>). While Maid Mint’s count is smaller than Pomu’s peak, it shows a devoted following. Pomu/Maid Mint’s story is unusual in that she went from indie → corporate → indie, and yet maintained a sizable audience. Many fans cheered her return as Maid Mint, seeing it as a “second chance” at streaming on her own terms.</li><li>: Gawr Gura, one of Hololive’s celebrated  talents and the single-most-subscribed VTuber in the world ((over 4.5 million subs (<a href=\"https://essential-japan.com/news/gawr-gura-to-leave-hololive-due-to-differences-with-management/#:~:text=During%20this%20period%20of%20activity%2C,subscribers%20on%20her%20primary%20platform\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">essential-japan.com</a>)), stunned the community in April 2025 by announcing her graduation effective May 1. The reason given was familiar: <em>“differences with management and the direction of the company”</em><a href=\"https://essential-japan.com/news/gawr-gura-to-leave-hololive-due-to-differences-with-management/#:~:text=Gawr%20Gura%20will%20officially%20leave,reason%20behind%20the%20shock%20announcement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">(essential-japan.com</a>). The news was met with heartbreak and speculation. In a twist echoing Fauna, just days after her last Hololive stream, fans discovered Gura’s new independent channel. Now rebranded as , her debut video quickly confirmed the speculation – and her audience reacted at warp speed. Within 24 hours, Sameko Saba’s YouTube and Twitter followed count exploded to <a href=\"https://www.jaxon.gg/hololives-gawr-gura-returning-independent-vtuber/#:~:text=followers,information%20about%20their%20past%20lives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">jaxon.gg</a>) (remember, that’s from near-zero overnight!). This makes Gura the latest example of a top VTuber successfully migrating to indie status without losing fan support. Cover Corp has emphasized that it still owns the “Gawr Gura” character, so the new persona has a different name and look, but the loyal fanbase nearly instantly crossed over (<a href=\"https://www.jaxon.gg/hololives-gawr-gura-returning-independent-vtuber/#:~:text=showing%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20sufficient%20to%20prove,recognized%20it%20as%20Gawr%20Gura\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">jaxon.gg</a>).</li></ul><p>Each of these graduations – Fauna, Selen, Pomu, Gura – sent shockwaves through the VTuber fandom. Fan reaction was overwhelmingly supportive of the talent. Social media exploded with messages like <em>“I’m loyal to my oshi (favorite), not the company</em><a href=\"https://hololivetoday.com/op-eds-list/corporate-to-indie-dynamic-between-models#:~:text=like%2C%20%E2%80%9CI%20am%20loyal%20to,to%20those%20starting%20from%20scratch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> (hololivetoday.com</a>). Viewers overwhelmingly took the side of the VTuber, trusting her narrative over the agency’s. Crowdfunding efforts like charity streams by Dokibird (raising $250K+) showed fans rallying to help the talent succeed. The common sentiment was that the content and personality of the individual, not the corporate label, were the real draw.</p><p>In many cases, <strong>ex-corporate VTubers have indeed thrived independently</strong>, backed by these fans. Both Dokibird and Nimi Nightmare hit <strong>half a million subscribers within days/weeks</strong> of debuting. Maid Mint found over 300K as an indie. Gura’s Sameko is at ~200K after just a day. These stars have already shown they can monetize directly: for example, Dokibird’s February 9 “Merch Launch” stream generated nearly  in YouTube superchats and tips (<a href=\"https://virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki/Dokibird#:~:text=On%209%20February%2C%20Dokibird%20held,Superchats%2C%20not%20counting%20Streamlabs%20tips\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">virtualyoutuber.fandom.com</a>) – more than she ever got as an agency talent in the same time span. Fauna’s merchandise sold out instantly. In short, the <strong>indie paths of these former corpo talents have been validated by the market</strong>: their audiences followed them and even expanded.</p><p>At the same time, it remains an open question whether <strong>completely new VTubers (with no corporate pedigree) can break out</strong> at a similar level. So far, the most successful independents are often veterans or have compelling niches. Even Filian, one of the biggest “Kojinzei” VTubers mentioned by Forbes, ironically joined a small agency in 2023, blurring the lines (<a href=\"https://www.news.viverse.com/post/top-indie-vtubers#:~:text=5%20Top%20Kojinzei%20VTubers%20You,Need%20to%20Know%20in%202024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">news.viverse.com</a>). Generally, analysts note that the indie viewership pie is dominated by the same “superstar” phenomenon: a few big names get the lion’s share of views (<a href=\"https://hololivetoday.com/op-eds-list/corporate-to-indie-dynamic-between-models#:~:text=just%20one%20tier%20below,select%20group%20of%20successful%20indies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hololivetoday.com</a>). Fresh faces will need something truly unique to garner mass appeal without an agency’s marketing engine. It’s still early, but the expectation in the community is that <strong>fan loyalty will follow personalities</strong> – so a crafty and charismatic new indie might still grow large, just as Dokibird did. But they will be entering a more competitive and saturated market.</p><h2>Industry Statistics: Viewership, Graduation Rates, and Revenue</h2><p>To understand these trends, it helps to look at the data. Third-party trackers and market analysts have documented how VTuber viewership and business metrics are evolving:</p><ul><li> StreamsCharts reports that over the past few quarters, VTuber audience growth has plateaued. After reaching record watch-hours in late 2023 and early 2024, the numbers leveled off. VTubers still command hundreds of millions of hours watched per quarter; Q3 2024 had about  watched (<a href=\"https://streamscharts.com/news/vtubers-q3-2024-report#:~:text=In%20Q3%202024%2C%20the%20number,compared%20to%20the%20previous%20quarter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">streamscharts.com</a>) (vs. 440M in Q2). By one analysis, live-stream viewership attributable to VTubers has grown 10× over 5 years (), indicating explosive long-term growth, but short-term quarterly figures are now flat or even slightly down. Unique active VTuber channels fell below 5,000 in Q3 2024 (<a href=\"https://streamscharts.com/news/vtubers-q3-2024-report#:~:text=In%20Q3%202024%2C%20the%20number,compared%20to%20the%20previous%20quarter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">streamscharts.com</a>), reflecting some consolidation.</li><li><strong>Agency vs Indie Market Share:</strong> Analysts estimate indies consistently hold around <strong>35–36% of total VTuber watch-time</strong>. StreamsCharts pie-charts for Q3 2024 show independents at about , compared to Hololive’s ~23.5% and Nijisanji’s 18.9% (<a href=\"https://streamscharts.com/news/vtubers-q3-2024-report#:~:text=,Viewership\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">streamscharts.com</a>). (Other agencies like VShojo, accelerators, etc., fill out the rest.) Hololive Today’s analysis similarly notes that independents have been stable at ~36% of viewership across recent quarters (<a href=\"https://hololivetoday.com/op-eds-list/corporate-to-indie-dynamic-between-models#:~:text=Analysing%20VTuber%20viewership%20as%20a,increases%20in%20their%20viewership%20figures\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hololivetoday.com</a>). In other words, while the top agencies are still large, indies now represent over one-third of the VTuber audience by watch-time. This split is unusual: most entertainment niches are far more concentrated. It underscores that the VTuber audience is fragmented and that no single agency fully dominates.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Graduation and Turnover Rates:</strong> Exact industry-wide figures are hard to come by, but 2024 saw unusually high turnover. ANYCOLOR closed its Indonesian and Indian NIJISANJI branches in 2023 and terminated several international talents. Cover also had multiple graduations and some suspensions. These high-profile exits (Fauna, Ame, Mumei, Gura, plus others like Hololive JP member Chloe, Aqua and Shion) have alarmed fans. For a sense of scale: NIJISANJI EN’s watch-hours fell by  in December 2024 (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kurosanji/comments/1hsmrif/vstats_december_2024_report_released_niji_overall/#:~:text=NijiEN%20,the%20same%20month%20last%20year\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reddit.com</a>) (partly due to losing talents and halting debuts), while NIJISANJI JP’s hours grew. StreamsCharts even noted that in late 2024, Nijisanji EN was by far the worst-performing branch of ANYCOLOR, leading to speculation about merging it back into the main company.</li><li> Despite short-term turbulence, the VTuber industry remains highly lucrative. In 2020, the top 300 YouTube channels that year made ~$26M from VTubers (<a href=\"https://www.konvoy.vc/newsletters/virtual-characters-and-live-streaming#:~:text=The%20VTubing%20market%20benefitted%20from,the%20Japanese%20VTuber%20agency%2C%20Hololive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">konvoy.vc</a>). Aggregate market research suggests  in global VTuber revenue. As noted, Zion Market Research estimated ~$6.3B market value in 2023 (<a href=\"https://www.zionmarketresearch.com/report/vtuber-virtual-youtuber-market#:~:text=Report%20Attributes%20Report%20Details%20Report,Tuber\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">zionmarketresearch.com</a>). (Other sources cite smaller or larger numbers, but all agree on a large, fast-growing market.) Much of this revenue comes from fan support: in the VTuber model, donations/superchats and merchandise sales form the bulk of income. For example, Kiryu Coco once earned ~$800K via superchats in a year (<a href=\"https://www.konvoy.vc/newsletters/virtual-characters-and-live-streaming#:~:text=The%20VTubing%20market%20benefitted%20from,the%20Japanese%20VTuber%20agency%2C%20Hololive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">konvoy.vc</a>). The new breakout indies are already pulling huge donation totals: Dokibird raised $252K for charity in early 2024 (<a href=\"https://virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki/Dokibird#:~:text=On%204%20March%2C%20the%20,6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">virtualyoutuber.fandom.com</a>), and Nimi Nightmare set a VTuber record by raising $361K in one charity stream (<a href=\"https://virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki/Nimi_Nightmare#:~:text=On%2021%20March%2C%20she%20held,5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">virtualyoutuber.fandom.com</a>). These figures illustrate that fans are willing to directly finance independent VTubers just as they did with agency stars.</li><li> The fortunes of VTuber agencies themselves have reflected these controversies. Both ANYCOLOR and Cover Corp (Hololive’s parent) are public companies in Japan, so their stock prices respond to news. For instance, ANYCOLOR’s shares  in the weeks following Selen Tatsuki’s termination and other setbacks (<a href=\"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/heres-why-anycolor-stock-slid-over-5-in-one-day-3337094#:~:text=Tatsuki%20had%20leveled%20allegations%20of,how%20it%20treats%20its%20talent\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">investing.com</a>). An analyst report noted that fans <em>“accused [ANYCOLOR] of mistreating its rising talent”</em> and pointed out the company’s repeated abrupt restructuring (closing whole country branches) (<a href=\"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/heres-why-anycolor-stock-slid-over-5-in-one-day-3337094#:~:text=Tatsuki%20had%20leveled%20allegations%20of,how%20it%20treats%20its%20talent\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">investing.com</a>). Cover Corp has weathered more stable growth, but even it has faced scrutiny. In early 2024, Cover publicized that it had taken legal action in  against fans/critics (<a href=\"https://cover-corp.com/en/news/detail/20240111#:~:text=Number%20of%20infringement%20of%20rights,in%20the%20time%20period%3A%20116\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cover-corp.com</a>), which some observers worried could hurt its image.</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://vtubersensei.com/2025/05/13/cover-corp-announces-record-revenue-for-fy2025/\">Cover’s latest financial report</a></p><h2>Controversies Undermining Agency Trust</h2><p>The shift toward indies is closely tied to a series of scandals and trust issues at the big agencies. Fans have grown increasingly aware of behind-the-scenes problems:</p><ul><li><strong>Abrupt Terminations and Non-Transparent Graduations:</strong> Agencies sometimes cite vague reasons for cutting ties. Fans were outraged by how arbitrarily Hololive or NIJISANJI jettisoned talent in 2024 and 2025. For example, both Fauna and Gura “graduated” with explanations like “management differences” (<a href=\"https://vchavcha.com/en/virtual-news/hololive-chloe-and-fauna-graduate/#:~:text=On%20December%201%2C%20Hololive%20EN%E2%80%99s,graduation%20as%20her%20path%20forward\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">vchavcha.com</a>) <a href=\"https://essential-japan.com/news/gawr-gura-to-leave-hololive-due-to-differences-with-management/#:~:text=Gawr%20Gura%20will%20officially%20leave,reason%20behind%20the%20shock%20announcement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">(essential-japan.com</a>), leaving fans to speculate what really happened. Anycolor’s sudden firing of Selen mid-leave was particularly poorly handled; Nijisanji’s official statement admitted they’d harassed her and her emergency contact while she was hospitalized after a suicidal attempt, further enraging the community. Many in VTubing now demand transparency: the lack of clear policy around terminations has seeded distrust.</li><li> Leaked industry knowledge suggests VTuber contracts heavily favor agencies. Talents often give up rights to their avatars and have little recourse if they quit. This has drawn parallels to older idol industries, and fans worry over abuse of power. Demands for standardized talent protections and fairer contracts have grown louder in the wake of major graduations.</li><li><strong>Management and Culture Clashes:</strong> Some controversies seem to arise from friction between Japanese corporations and overseas talents. Both Hololive and Nijisanji have noted <em>“cultural differences between Japanese and non-Japanese work environments”</em> as an issue (<a href=\"https://hololivetoday.com/op-eds-list/corporate-to-indie-dynamic-between-models#:~:text=Recently%2C%20discussions%20have%20intensified%20around,escape%20from%20restrictive%20corporate%20practices\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hololivetoday.com</a>). Non-Japanese VTubers (especially in EN divisions) have at times felt unsupported or misunderstood by management. The NiJi EN division in particular collapsed largely amidst mismanagement allegations. Many English-speaking talents have left NiJi EN in the past year for new careers or indies (Zaion Lanza, Pomu, in addition to Selen). Fans interpret this exodus as evidence that ANYCOLOR lost the trust of its foreign talent.</li><li><strong>Heavy-Handed Fandom Policing:</strong> Cover Corp’s recent legal crackdown on fan posts (filing disclosure requests to unmask anonymous posters, as reported by their PR) (<a href=\"https://cover-corp.com/en/news/detail/20240111#:~:text=Number%20of%20infringement%20of%20rights,in%20the%20time%20period%3A%20116\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cover-corp.com</a>) upset many community members. While intended to protect VTubers from harassment, critics saw it as bullying the community. ANYCOLOR likewise has been harsh on social media, one-finding and suspending fans for criticism. These actions, combined with perceived secrecy, have made supporters feel unwelcome. In effect, agencies seem more focused on controlling criticism than addressing the root causes of discontent.</li></ul><p>In sum, there’s a growing narrative that <strong>agencies have mismanaged or exploited their talents</strong>. The repeated emergence of similar issues – sudden graduations, legal threats, and cultural clashes – has convinced many fans that agency systems are fragile and not always in the talent’s best interest (<a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/24065311/vtuber-selen-tatsuki-nijisanji-termination-dokibird#:~:text=But%20while%20agencies%20have%20been,that%20hasn%E2%80%99t%20been%20seen%20before\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">polygon.com</a>) (<a href=\"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/heres-why-anycolor-stock-slid-over-5-in-one-day-3337094#:~:text=Tatsuki%20had%20leveled%20allegations%20of,how%20it%20treats%20its%20talent\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">investing.com</a>).</p><h2>Permanent Shift or Passing Phase?</h2><p>Is the rise of indie VTubing just a temporary reaction or a lasting industry realignment? The evidence points to a possible , but also to caution:</p><ul><li> A fundamental change is that fans now visibly assert loyalty to individuals over companies (<a href=\"https://hololivetoday.com/op-eds-list/corporate-to-indie-dynamic-between-models#:~:text=like%2C%20%E2%80%9CI%20am%20loyal%20to,to%20those%20starting%20from%20scratch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hololivetoday.com</a>). This ideological shift is likely enduring: once viewers recognize a person behind the avatar, they tend to follow that person wherever they go. Agencies used to cultivate brand loyalty (hololive vs. nijisanji, etc.), but the exodus of stars is fracturing that pattern. Companies may need to adapt by treating talent as more than disposable IP.</li><li><strong>Indie Viability and Precedent:</strong> The success stories above show that indie careers can rival corporate ones. When enough data points (like Dokibird, Nimi, Maid Mint, Sameko) demonstrate profitability and reach for indies, more talents and fans will believe it. This could lead to a reinforcing loop: the more big names prove they can go solo, the more other talents will consider it, potentially shrinking the agency pool.</li><li> Faced with talent flight, agencies might respond by reforming. There are signs Cover and ANYCOLOR are experimenting with more flexible arrangements. For instance, Cover has allowed some graduated talents to get an “Affiliate” status, as a way to keep them engaged. ANYCOLOR promised changes for NiJi EN after Selen’s exit (though details remain scarce). If agencies can offer slightly better terms – more freedom, better communication – they might stabilize. But if profits decline because top earners leave, they’ll have to make real changes.</li><li> The VTuber boom may be entering a mature phase. Niche communities are fracturing, new platforms (like VR or Kick streams) are emerging, and competition is heating up. Markets often oscillate: after rapid expansion comes consolidation or correction. We may see smaller agencies fold (like “production kawaii” or “idol”) and the large ones refocus, or new models (like affiliation status) arise. However, unlike a flash-in-the-pan trend, VTubing has shown staying power across multiple years and geographies (see rise of Nijisanji China, India, etc.).</li><li><strong>Global and Technological Factors:</strong> Finally, VTubing is riding larger tech waves – from more accessible AR/VR setups to AI-generated avatars. These trends favor more indie creators (easy avatar creation, generative tools) and could fuel sustained growth. Corporate VTubers may then face competition not only from human indies but also from AI-driven avatars.</li></ul><p>, while the recent surge in indie VTubing owes much to current controversies, it taps into deeper shifts: fan loyalty to personalities and wider tech democratization. It’s likely not just a short-lived rebellion. However, agencies still have powerful infrastructure, and new talents will continue to emerge through both models. The future VTuber industry may be more mixed than ever – a blend of polished corporate acts and scrappy independents, each learning from the other. If agencies can regain trust (perhaps by improving talent contracts and transparency), they may coexist with a vibrant indie scene. If not, we could see a  where the most famous VTubers are largely self-managed, with agencies playing a supporting or niche role.</p>","contentLength":24495,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://vtubersensei.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/vtuber-agencies-proportions-by-viewership.png?w=1000","enclosureMime":"text/html","commentsUrl":null}],"tags":["VTubers"]}
