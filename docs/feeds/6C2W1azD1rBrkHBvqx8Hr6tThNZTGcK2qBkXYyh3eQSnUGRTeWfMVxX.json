Internship 2025: Learning About Business Strategy and Production","url":"https://coveredge.cover-corp.com/en/list/3223","date":1761188400,"author":"cover_hirata","guid":1255,"unread":true,"content":"<h2>What is COVER’s Summer Internship?</h2><p>It was another scorching hot summer this year – how did everyone spend it?</p><p>In mid-August, COVER held a three-day hands-on Summer Internship program designed for students to experience business production and learn how to structure business development through practical exercises. Through the program, participants had the opportunity to experience the actual process of creating new business ideas, particularly in the entertainment industry, and to receive direct feedback from upper management. The internship aims to give students a firsthand understanding of COVER’s approach to business strategy and how new projects are brought to life.&nbsp;</p><p>We spoke with the team in charge of the Summer Internship to learn more about its purpose.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;“The purpose of this program is to give participating students the opportunity to learn and experience the following three key aspects:</p><ul><li>To understand the strategic thinking and processes behind management within the entertainment industry</li><li>To experience the planning and development processes of business projects within the entertainment field</li><li>To gain a firsthand understanding of COVER’s new business creation centered on VTubers, while receiving mentorship and feedback from professionals on-site.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>That’s why, for the Summer Internship 2025, we set a clear goal: to deliver presentations from multiple perspectives and receive direct feedback from the executive team.&nbsp;</p><p>At COVER, the Corporate Planning Division plays a vital role in, not simply coming up with ideas, but bringing those ideas to life, supporting them, putting them on a stable trajectory and ensuring they are profitable. Through this internship, we wanted students to understand the process and approach required to turn a business concept into reality as we believe that understanding this kind of thinking and workflow will serve them well in any career path they pursue – whether as working professionals or as future members of a corporate planning team.”</p><h2>Experiencing Business Production in COVER’s Corporate Planning Division</h2><p>So what exactly did the Summer Internship 2025 look like?</p><p>This year’s program invited nine students, who were divided into teams of three, to take on a three-day challenge in business production.</p><p>Here is how the three-day program unfolded:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Day 1 ― Group Work Begins</strong></p><p>The program kicked off with an opening meeting, followed by introductions to members of the Corporate Planning Division who would be supporting the students as mentors throughout the internship. After a casual lunch where everyone got to know each other a little better, the mentors gave an overview of COVER’s main areas of business, adjacent industries, and potential markets before students were divided into their respective teams and their group work finally began!</p><p><strong>Day 2 ― Creating Proposals for a  New Business”</strong></p><p>Day 2 began with a quick morning meeting before diving straight into group work. Students were not just merely coming up with business ideas – if they stayed as “pie-in-the-sky” concepts, the experience would not have been quite as meaningful. With guidance from their mentors, students learned how to analyze businesses, design new business plans, and evaluate profitability and risk, as they continued to expand and shape their ideas. The group work continued after lunch, and the day wrapped up with progress reports and feedback sessions as everyone prepared for the final presentations.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Day 3 ― Bringing It All Together: Presenting Before the Executive Team</strong></p><p>The final day also began with group work after the customary morning meeting. To ensure each group’s well-thought-out business ideas came across clearly, mentors shared tips on how to deliver effective presentations and helped the students refine their proposal materials. At 5 p.m. on the final day, the presentations began with CEO Tanigo and other members of the executive team in attendance.&nbsp;</p><h3>Final Day Presentation Report</h3><p>Summer Internship presentations were governed by three main rules: (1) 15 minutes for the presentation and 5 minutes for Q&amp;A, (2) strict time management, (3) no updates to the materials after submission. With those rules in place, each team arrived early at the venue alongside their mentors from the Corporate Planning Division to carefully go over their presentation materials.</p><p>As the clock neared 5 p.m. and the presentations were about to begin, members of the executive team started to fill out the venue one after another; the interns focused and determined. The session began with each team giving their presentation, followed by Q&amp;A sessions with the executives. After a short break, the event concluded with the awarding of the Excellence Award and feedback from CEO Tanigo.</p><p>Proposals included a social contribution project that utilizes COVER’s motion tracking technology to digitize and pass down the skills of experienced professionals, an immersive theme park concept where fans and talents can go between each other’s worlds, and a digital tabletop figure device designed to enhance and support fans’  activities.</p><p>During the feedback session, executives praised the students for their fresh perspectives and out-of-the-box thinking when coming up with ideas not bound by the conventions of the VTuber industry, as well as the feasibility of their proposals. This&nbsp; also served as the perfect opportunity for executives to share their insights on COVER’s vision for the future and offering practical advice on how to approach business planning.&nbsp;</p><h2>Looking Back on Summer Internship 2025</h2><h3>Feedback from Participants</h3><ul><li>We received feedback from perspectives we’d never considered before. It really made me realize the sincerity behind the advice we were given.&nbsp;</li><li>It was an invaluable experience to hear directly from the company’s top executives.</li><li>Through this experience, I learned that creating a business isn’t just about coming up with ideas. It’s about analyzing successful cases, understanding their core elements, and finding ways to differentiate them. The insights I gained here will definitely help shape my future approach to business.</li><li>I was able to move past surface-level trends for success and develop a more fundamental way of thinking. Getting direct feedback from the executives also helped me understand how real business decisions are made: something that will surely be a major asset in my career.&nbsp;</li><li>The mentoring sessions were especially meaningful. Every conversation was packed with insights and learning.</li></ul><h3>Reflections from the Program Coordinator</h3><h4>On the Final Day Presentations</h4><p>What stood out was how seriously each team considered the question “Why COVER be the one to take on this business idea?”</p><p>Their approaches were truly diverse – some worked backward from COVER’s strengths, others analyzed markets that could be accessed from our existing areas of business, and some made sure their ideas were grounded in solid reasoning to address real-world challenges. Rather than simply envisioning a “New business,” they kept asking themselves what it truly means for COVER to lead such an initiative giving depth and credibility to every proposal, which is what left the strongest impression on me.&nbsp;</p><p>What stood out to me was how each team built their projects around open discussions. Every member’s ideas could be seen in the final presentations – a true reflection of how well they collaborated.<p>We also held a short mid-program sharing session, where each team had five minutes to share their progress, challenges, and proposed solutions. Hearing other teams’ perspectives sparked new ideas and helped participants have a fresh take on their own projects and spot missing elements in their own proposals, expanding the scope of their learning. The sharing session encouraged more open communication within and across teams, which I believe ultimately led to higher quality presentations.</p></p><p>COVER continues to grow under its mission, “Together, Let’s Create Culture Loved by All,” driven by the challenge of elevating VTubers into a culture loved by people around the world. COVER’s greatest strength lies in its personnel – professionals from diverse backgrounds in creative, business, and technology, who respect and inspire one another and work together to achieve a common goal.&nbsp;</p><p>This internship offers a special opportunity to experience the passion and business innovation that drive COVER.</p><p>We’re excited to see the participants go on to create  that inspires people around the world together with COVER!&nbsp;</p>","contentLength":8545,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The Story Behind Our Warehouse Consolidation: Logistics Reform at COVER","url":"https://coveredge.cover-corp.com/en/list/3238","date":1760583600,"author":"平松梨沙","guid":1194,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Hiroki Yoshino has forged a career in the logistics field, working across logistics strategy, process and service design, and cost optimization and companies such as NIPPON SHUPPAN HANBAI INC., Rakuten Group, Inc., SIGMAXYZ Inc.<p>From 2014, he spent ten years as an Executive Officer in charge of logistics at MonotaRO Co.,Ltd. , where he led the development of a nationwide logistics center network, including the launch of several large-scale facilities. He also promoted automation within the company by introducing more than 1,300 AGVs (automated guided vehicles), while taking charge of end-to-end operations including demand forecasting, inventory management, and customer support.&nbsp;</p>After serving as Executive Vice President at GROUND Inc., he was appointed CEO of L2, Inc. in 2025.</p><p><strong>COVER Corporation/Senior Vice President in charge of merchandising, e-commerce and logistics</strong></p><p>Daisuke Maeda was involved in launching several internet businesses at Sumitomo Corporation. Thereafter, he served as president of Soukai Drug Malaysia and MonotaRO Indonesia consecutively. After returning to Japan, he joined RAKSUL and was appointed Executive Officer for the sales division for printing and customer attraction. In 2024, he became a Senior Vice President at COVER Corporation.</p><h2>Taking Logistics to the Next Level with a Logistics Professional</h2><h3>―To start with, what made you come on board to support COVER’s logistics reform?</h3><div><div><p>I had worked with Mr. Yoshino in my previous role, so I reached out to him for some advice on our logistics challenges – and that’s how the conversation started.<p>I joined COVER in July 2024, (see </p><a href=\"https://coveredge.cover-corp.com/en/list/694\">related article</a>), but even before I officially came on board, I’d already heard about some of the challenges in our logistics operations. With both the production side and the company as a whole growing so quickly, our logistics operations hadn’t quite caught up, which is why I reached out to Mr. Yoshino and asked him to come on as an advisor to help guide us through our full-scale logistics reform.</p></div></div><h3>―Mr. Yoshino, what were your initial thoughts about getting involved with COVER?</h3><div><div><p>At first, I didn’t know much about COVER or the VTuber industry, so I started by doing some of my own research. That’s when I realized this was an exciting new form of entertainment with global potential and the more I learned, the more it sparked my curiosity, and found myself becoming genuinely excited to be a part of it.</p></div></div><h3>―You both have extensive experience in e-commerce and logistics. What was your honest impression when you first looked at our logistics setup?</h3><div><div><p>I felt that it was somewhat simplistic, but also challenging as there is a long supply chain extending from production all the way to the customer.&nbsp;We handle a variety of products – many with long lead times – and logistics volumes can spike suddenly depending on talent anniversaries or special events. This kind of fluctuation* adds an extra layer of complexity. That said, I saw plenty of room for improvement.&nbsp;<p>*Fluctuations in logistics volume are due to a range of factors, including seasonal demand, social trends, and special events.&nbsp;</p></p></div></div><div><div><p>There are three key management perspectives I believe are essential when thinking about logistics.The first is <strong>the scale and location of logistics centers</strong>; the second being <strong>the use of IT – both in systems and logistics infrastructure</strong>; and third is  itself.&nbsp;<p>Looking at COVER as a whole, I felt that because the company is still in a phase of rapid growth, there’s room for improvement across all three.</p></p></div></div><h2>Looking Ahead to Optimizing Global Logistics: Taking a Mid-Term Approach to Reform</h2><h3>―Let’s dive deeper into the details of this reform. As the merchandising side of the business continues to grow, how are you approaching logistical improvements?</h3><div><div><p>To start, we look at logistics through a  framework.There’s logistics for individual fans and also corporate logistics (B2B), such as retail stores and pop-up events. Each of these is further divided into domestic and international.&nbsp;<p>Right now, our B2B logistics for overseas markets is still relatively small, but when it comes to international individual fan orders, we’re already seeing a steady growth in volume.</p>Currently, those cross-border shipments are handled by the same domestic warehouses as the ones we use for Japan. But because those warehouses are spread out across the country and because we’re working with different delivery partners within Japan as opposed to overseas, it has created some logistical inefficiencies we need to address.&nbsp;</p></div></div><h3>―I see. So am I right in saying that this is what has led to consolidating everything into this new logistics center?</h3><div><div><p>Exactly. As the first step in our improvement efforts, we consolidated our warehouses (see <a href=\"https://cover-corp.com/en/news/detail/20250625-03\">related article</a>) to boost overall efficiency, and from there, we plan to review our delivery partnerships and continue making further improvements.&nbsp;</p></div></div><h3>―So there appears to be multiple phases: could you tell us more about each stage of the plan?</h3><div><div><p>We’re approaching this project in three phases, with the first phase being the <strong>consolidation of our warehouses </strong>that I just mentioned. The second phase, which we’re right in the middle of, focuses on enhancing <strong>the service level of our domestic delivery operations</strong>, and the third phase will be strengthening our <strong>international supply chain</strong>. We expect the full process to take about two years.&nbsp;<p>We just finished consolidating our warehouses which started about a year ago in August last year and now, over the course of the next year, we’ll be focusing on improving delivery operations and overall productivity, while also beginning to work on optimizing our international logistics.&nbsp;</p></p></div></div><div><div><p>We also restructured our logistics partnerships as part of consolidating the warehouses.</p></div></div><div><div><p>This has involved important decisions that could influence the future of COVER, so we made sure to commit to a competitive bidding process and made a fair judgement based on factors like long-term potential, competitiveness and other key factors.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div><div><p>As we look toward future growth, it’s vital to work with partners we can truly trust, and grow with, over the long term.&nbsp;I was fortunate enough to be part of the bidding process this time around, and am honored to be entrusted with such an important role.&nbsp;</p></div></div><h3>―Now that your logistics partners are in place, it sounds like you’re making progress on your future logistics framework.&nbsp;</h3><div><div><p>Improving logistics alone isn’t enough for our loyal fans.&nbsp;What really matters is <strong>QCD – quality, cost, and delivery</strong>.It’s about delivering great products quickly and affordably, without compromising on quality.&nbsp;<p>That’s why alongside building our logistics framework, we’re also working on strengthening our internal structures.</p>We’ve launched a new SCM (Supply Chain Management) division, and we’re bringing in professionals experienced in areas like global sourcing, cost control, payment operations, and quality management.&nbsp;</p></div></div><h2>Upscaling through Warehouse Consolidation: Powering Better Fan Experiences</h2><h3>―Your new logistics center officially began standalone operations in June, but what was the main reason behind consolidating your warehouses?</h3><div><div><p>The main reason we consolidated our warehouses into a new logistics center was to take advantage of the scale that comes with centralizing our operations. By bringing everything under one roof, we can better control costs, ensure more consistent service levels, and standardize our overall logistics management.&nbsp;<p>While the volume of orders is still small, having multiple warehouses isn’t a major issue, but as business scales, it starts to impact operational inefficiency. Having a number of warehouses in different locations can drive up costs, increase the chance of stockouts, and can make it harder to standardize workflows and control service levels.</p></p></div></div><div><div><p>Of course, as order volumes grow and we continue to have more and more customers from all parts of the world, there may come a time when we need to increase the number of logistics hubs, but for now, our focus is on improving efficiency and accuracy by consolidating operations into a single center.&nbsp;</p></div></div><h3>―As you mentioned earlier, logistics are closely linked with talent activities, which means merchandise volume can fluctuate quite a bit. How do you view the challenges that come with that?&nbsp;</h3><div><div><p>That’s definitely one of the trickiest parts – deciding whether to base your logistics capacity on peak periods, like spikes around talent anniversaries, etc., or on quieter times of the year. If you prepare solely for those peak periods, you may end up with excess merchandise during regular periods, but if you plan for the downtimes, you’ll be overwhelmed when demand surges. Finding the right balance through data analyses will be a key challenge moving forward.</p></div></div><div><div><p>When you take into account the full impact of demand fluctuations, it becomes really tough to keep things balanced, but since many of our products are made to order, there’s an opportunity to create more even operations throughout the year by using lead times before shipping to prepare accordingly. The challenge we face, however, is that leveling out operations can sometimes lead to longer delivery times, so to avoid this, we believe it’s crucial to automate certain processes and increase throughput (processing volume per unit of time).</p></div></div><h3>―What kinds of advantages come from consolidating logistics hubs?</h3><div><div><p>Once products arrive at a logistics center, they go through the same series of steps before being handed off to a delivery partner:&nbsp;<strong>Inspection → Shelving → Storage → Picking → Sorting (for orders with multiple items) → Packing</strong><p>This flow doesn’t really change, no matter the type of products nor the size of the facility. That’s why consolidation creates scaling advantages. By centralizing operations, we can invest in better equipment and automation, making each step more efficient and it also helps shorten lead times and improve overall quality.&nbsp;</p></p></div></div><div><div><p>As we improve lead times within the warehouse, we expect overall delivery timelines to shorten, which is a big benefit for our fans. Until now, having multiple warehouses meant higher shipping costs and added overhead expenses from managing each location separately, so cutting back on some of these costs by making these adjustments gives us more opportunities to give back to our fans.&nbsp;There have also been positive developments from a corporate point of view as well. For example, we’ve been able to reduce the number of truck deliveries, which contributes to lower CO2 emissions, and there are now more possibilities for us to further increase our sustainability, through reducing plastic use, introducing returnable containers, and switching to lighter packaging materials.</p></div></div><h2>Automation and Robotics in the Logistics Center: Upgrading Our Management Systems</h2><h3>― Could you expand a little on the importance of logistical information technology from a management perspective that Mr. Yoshino mentioned earlier.</h3><div><div><p>From my experience, there’s a point where automation and system upgrades become essential for sustaining future growth: when the volume of daily shipments exceeds roughly 3,000 to 4,000.<p>If we break down our current annual volume, we’re already averaging close to 4,000 shipments per day, so this is indeed the right time to level up our logistics infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>That said, deciding how far to go with automation is important. We can invest heavily in state-of-the-art systems, but it’s hard to know when actual demand or on-site operations will catch up, which is why our fundamental approach is to upgrade the level of automation in line with each growth phase, while keeping a close eye on depreciation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div></div><h3>―Could you tell us more about what technologies and systems are being introduced at the new logistics center?</h3><div><div><p>We’ve started automating key operations inside the logistics center, particularly in areas like sorting and packing, by introducing robotics to streamline workflows.&nbsp;<p>We’ve also upgraded both our order management systems (OMS) and warehouse management systems (WMS) to support more advanced order management. By connecting these systems to our core platform, we’re aiming to </p><strong>improve lead times and inventory control</strong>, making it easier to manage stock levels more efficiently.We are all united in our mission to increase work efficiency, improve product quality and shorten lead times inside the warehouse every day.</p></div></div><h3>―How are you approaching logistics optimization?</h3><div><div><p>We’ve created a system that allows us to work even closer with our logistics partners through all phases from the initial planning stages to on-the-ground logistical operations. One key focus is making sure our operations are visible and data-driven, because by sharing real-time data, we can create a further seamless connection between our planning team and those who carry such plans out.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div><div><p>Exactly. It’s not uncommon for companies to fully outsource logistics and end up with little visibility into what’s actually happening on the ground. COVER is taking a very active role in sharing information with both internal and external partners. By visualizing key data, like customer orders, inventory, and real-time progress on the floor, and setting clear KPIs, both sides can remain on the same page and work together to make any necessary improvements. This is where the idea of having long-term partners we can grow with, which I mentioned earlier, really comes into play because operations can be optimized with these kinds of collaboration. I’d say we’re just now entering a cycle of continuous improvement.&nbsp;</p></div></div><h2>Providing Talent Experiences in 3D: Logistics as a Pillar of Growth</h2><h3>―What kind of feedback have you received from fans regarding the logistical challenges COVER faces?&nbsp;</h3><div><div><p>We receive all kinds of feedback from fans, but the comments we get most frequently is that delivery times are too slow, or that they were disappointed that their order didn’t arrive by particular dates such as talent anniversaries. We also understand that overseas fans are concerned about shipping fees and are fully aware that these operational issues require our utmost attention, but this project provides a solid foundation for us to address such issues one at a time.&nbsp;</p></div></div><h3>―What value do logistical improvements bring to COVER?</h3><div><div><p>Roughly half of COVER’s revenue comes from merchandise and for talents who exist in the virtual space, merchandise plays a crucial role in delivering real-world, three-dimensional value to the VTuber experience. In that sense, merchandise isn’t just a product – it’s a vital connection between our talents and their fans and is one of the most important ways we can deliver products and services with true value, and strengthening logistics is essential to sustaining such connections. Logistics is at the foundation of any successful business striving for continued growth and its optimization is paramount in getting important merchandise to fans, so improving these processes will hopefully lead to a better overall fan experience.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Many people these days expect their online order to arrive at their door the following day, but without a fully-fledged logistics infrastructure, incorrect shipments and lengthy delivery times are not uncommon. Hence why we’re committed to making these operational improvements: reducing lead times and ensuring every delivery is accurate.&nbsp;<p>Given all of this, I believe improvements to COVER’s logistics can make a significant contribution to raising the overall service level of our business. We can see improvements across the board in quality, cost and delivery (QCD) through the consolidation of our warehouse that aims to improve both accuracy and efficiency, but we will continue to refine operations and steadily develop in order to meet the expectations of many more of our loyal fans.</p></p></div></div><h3>―What are some of the unique challenges you have faced when trying to implement logistical improvements at COVER?</h3><div><div><p>One of the unique challenges we face is managing orders that include both pre-order and in-stock items. To deliver them together, we need to reserve inventory in advance and then coordinate the packing process to align with pre-order shipment schedules. It’s a complex workflow, and figuring out how to streamline it has been a key focus: definitely one of the more distinctive aspects of logistics here at COVER.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Looking ahead to the future, one of COVER’s key challenges will be designing and optimizing a global supply chain. Currently, international fans purchase merchandise through cross-border e-commerce channels, but in the future, we may need to establish overseas production hubs and strategically redesign the entire supply chain.&nbsp;If we can build a global supply chain framework, we’ll be able to significantly shorten delivery times and ultimately improve satisfaction levels among our international fans, making this logistics improvement project an important first step toward achieving our global vision.&nbsp;</p></div></div><h3>―Thank you. Finally, could you share your vision for the future?</h3><div><div><p>As I mentioned earlier about the global supply chain, we’re aiming to manufacture and distribute merchandise worldwide going forward: to bring joy to fans around the world, optimizing our supply chain is essential. That’s why we’ll continue to refine our operations through ongoing system upgrades and automation initiatives.&nbsp;<p>On the other hand, when it comes to domestic logistics, building a system aligned with ESG (environmental, social, and governance – a set of criteria used to evaluate a company’s sustainability and social responsibility) principles is becoming increasingly important, including reducing the amount of packaging materials used, simplifying and minimizing packaging, and improving energy efficiency through warehouse consolidation. Our goal is to create a logistics operation that’s thoughtful to, not just our fans, but the planet as well.&nbsp;</p></p></div></div><div><div><p>When we think about the future of logistics, one major issue that can’t be ignored is the growing shortage of labor. And it’s not just limited to logistics, it’s a challenge that many industries are struggling with today. On the flip side, we believe what is most essential here at COVER is building efficient operations and with the rapid advancements in logistics technology, such as automation equipment and increasingly sophisticated software, we can combine IT and system-based solutions to achieve this goal.&nbsp;<p>Implementing new technologies in logistics isn’t something that can be done in a day. We’re working closely alongside our business teams to design forward-looking systems.&nbsp;</p></p></div></div>","contentLength":18632,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Passion Etched into Cities: The Rise of hololive Support Advertising in Japan and Beyond","url":"https://coveredge.cover-corp.com/en/list/3144","date":1759978800,"author":"平松梨沙","guid":1157,"unread":true,"content":"<p><strong>Virtual Sakura Shrine 35P PR Team/Sakura Miko 7th Anniversary Support Ad&nbsp;</strong><strong>Captain Marine’s Overseas Birthday Support Ad/Houshou Marine Birthday &amp; 6th Anniversary Support Ad</strong><strong>JDON MY SOUL CLUB/Hakos Baelz 4th Anniversary Support Ad</strong><strong>vivid comedy project/Kikirara Vivi Birthday Support Ad</strong></p><h2><strong>The Sudden Rise of Support Ads: A New Trend in the Ever-Expanding  Market</strong></h2><p>In recent years, support ads have been drawing increasing attention as a key part of . The “<a href=\"https://www.jeki.co.jp/info/detail/?id=1330)\">Oshi-katsu &amp; Cheering Ads Survey 2024 (推し活・応援広告調査2024)</a>” , released by JR East Marketing &amp; Communications, Inc. in February 2025, found that planning, funding, or visiting support ads ranked among the top three ways fans celebrate their ’s special days. The survey also revealed that awareness of support ads has reached 59% among people actively engaged in  – an increase of 14.7 points from the previous year – highlighting the steady rise in recognition year after year.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the survey, the potential market for support ads is estimated around 76.9 billion yen – equivalent to about 10% of the overall  market, valued at roughly 800 billion yen. Originating from  (birthday) ads, as seen in South Korea’s K-pop fan culture, support ads began to spread widely in Japan following an idol audition program in 2019 since which they have firmly established themselves as one of the key ways fans express their support.&nbsp;</p><p>The survey also found that after running a support ad, about 80% of fans said it led them to engage more actively in other  activities – such as attending events or purchasing merchandise and CDs. In addition, 60% of people who saw a support ad said it sparked their interest in the featured talent, showing how these ads play a major role in expanding fan communities.&nbsp;The spread of support ads has shown how much of a natural fit it is within VTuber culture, and in recent years they’ve been drawing increased attention. A unique part of VTuber culture is the sheer abundance of fan-driven UGC and the extraordinary passion behind it, from highlight clips and fan art to music production and translation efforts, where fans actively take on the role of creator, building the culture alongside the VTubers themselves. Support ads stand out among these forms of expression as one of the most visible ways to showcase fan dedication.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Full-Scale Efforts Since Winter 2023: COVER Support Ads</strong></h2><p>At COVER, we also actively support fan-organized support ads as a form of UGC.&nbsp;</p><p>From the outset, we have had <a href=\"https://hololivepro.com/en/terms/\">derivative works guidelines</a> in place, which include clear rules specific to support ads outlining prohibited expressions that could be mistaken for official advertising, making sure support ads are clearly labeled as such, and emphasizing the need for originality. They also cover other basic prohibitions, such as third-party rights infringement, to ensure that fans can engage in their creative activities with peace of mind.&nbsp;</p><p>When fans submit their planned support ads via the form provided as part of the guidelines, we review ad visuals and share the information with the talent in the form of a report. As a token of appreciation, we also send fans a thank-you card and a key chain.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>COVER’s Support Ad Application Process</strong></h3><p> Fans submit their support ad plans to the company</p><p> We check the ad visuals, confirm the applicant’s X account details, and request that they share their X post with us</p><p> Once the post is confirmed, we share and report the ad to the talent</p><p> As a token of appreciation for running a support ad, we send fans an exclusive novelty item.&nbsp;</p><p>These efforts to help promote support ads began in the winter of 2023, when we started receiving a growing number of inquiries about support ads and other fan-led initiatives. In response to these requests, our Legal and Creator Relations team took the lead in establishing clear guidelines, strengthening our commitment to supporting UGC and paving the way for a more structured approach to support ads.&nbsp;</p><p>The growing popularity of support ads is evident by the numbers alone: from just 4 in April 2024 to 29 in April 2025 – an increase of almost fivefold in a single year. Since October 2024, the use of the hashtag #holocheer on X has further boosted visibility, as talents react to ads and fans share their impressions online.</p><p>Today, support ads can be seen across a wide range of media, from station posters and wrapped buses to digital billboards and advertising trucks. Station ads still remain the most common format however: a frequent sight in places such as Akihabara.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong><strong>Support Ads Powered by Fan Communities: Trends from 40 Supporting Ads cases</strong></strong></h2><p>An analysis of the roughly 40 support ads carried out in July and August 2025 showed that the majority of the ads were birthday-related, accounting for about half of the total. For example, a crowdfunded ad was on display at Akihabara Station to celebrate Kikirara Vivi’s birthday, while fans from South Korea, Malaysia, and Hong Kong came together to launch an international campaign for Houshou Marine’s birthday as well.</p><p>The next most common type of support ads are those celebrating anniversaries, which have been steadily increasing year by year. For example, Sakura Miko’s 7th anniversary was marked with large-scale ads across three major Japanese train stations, Shinjuku, Ikebukuro, and Akihabara, drawing significant attention. The 5th anniversary of “miComet,” the unit formed by Sakura Miko and Hoshimachi Suisei, was also celebrated not only in Japan, but also with ads displayed in Singapore at the same time.&nbsp;</p><p>In Japan, support ads are most commonly placed at major stations such as Akihabara, Shinjuku, Ikebukuro, and Kokusai-Tenjijo. Of these, Akihabara Station – beloved by many as the “sacred site of VTuber culture” – stands out as the location with the highest number of placements. At the same time, ads displayed in unique locations that reflect a talent’s personality have also grabbed people’s attention. For instance, support ads for Rindo Chihaya, who has ties to horse racing, could be seen at Kanazawa Racecourse, while ads for hololive GAMERS were on display at Obihiro’s Banei Racecourse – showcasing the creativity and ingenuity that fans possess.&nbsp;</p><p>A representative for the group vivid comedy project, who organized a birthday ad for Kikirara Vivi from August 25 to 31, shared their motivations for running support ads: “We wanted to create a support ad so that more people could see just how charming Vivi-chan is. It was also a way to show our gratitude, and to let people who happen to spot the ad in the city discover what a wonderful talent she is.”</p><p>Their support ads could be seen in Akihabara and Namba, Osaka: “We chose these locations because Akihabara is a cultural hub that attracts many fans and tourists, making it the perfect place to capture the attention of people who may not yet know Vivi-chan, and we also wanted locals in Osaka, her hometown, to be proud of her success,” they explained.</p><p>“The criteria that needs to be met when support ads are screened vary depending on the area, and station ads in particular require a little more time to adjust any wording to meet the relevant guidelines and to confirm usage rights. Since this was our first time creating a support ad, we were running behind schedule and couldn’t quite achieve everything we had hoped, but even so, being able to place ads that reflected the uniqueness of both Akihabara and Osaka made us feel that we were able to share Vivi-chan’s appeal with many different people,“ said the vivid comedy project representative.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Crowdfunding to Discord: The Fan Communities Driving Support Ads</strong></h2><p>Support ad projects have given fans the ability to participate and collaborate in a number of different ways. Large-scale initiatives often turn to crowdfunding platforms to gather support, while project announcements and progress updates are typically shared on social media such as X and Instagram. Overseas, many projects are organized through Discord servers, enabling local fan communities to take the lead and build international collaborations. Project organizers also use hashtags like “#____supportadproject” on X to recruit collaborators, often working together with fans who are skilled in design and illustration.&nbsp;</p><p>Produced by the Virtual Sakura Shrine 35P PR Team, the 7th Anniversary Support Ad for Sakura Miko appeared in four cities – Tokyo, Osaka, Aichi, Fukuoka.</p><p>“As Sakura Miko reached this major milestone of her 7th anniversary, we wanted to express our gratitude and celebrate in a way that was visible to everyone,” said a team representative in reflection of the anniversary project. As this project was only possible through crowdfunding, the locations of the ads were carefully considered. Akihabara was selected for its high foot traffic with a higher proportion of passersby familiar with VTuber culture, Nagoya in order to give fans outside the Kanto region the chance to enjoy the ads, and Fukuoka was included because many of the crowdfunding supporters happened to live there.</p><p>“The response on social media was amazing – we saw so many posts of people saying ‘I went to see it!’, ‘It was so cute!’, and ‘Happy 7th Anniversary, Miko!’ A lot of people even took photos in front of the ads with merch such as hololive friends plushes. It made me really happy to see how the ads were able to become a way for everyone to share in the celebrations, but the comment that has stayed with me the most was one that said, ‘I’m so glad I’ve stayed a fan all this time,’ reminding me that the memories Sakura Miko have created with all the fans are still ever present in their hearts.”<p>The representative also looked back on how the project drew even greater attention after being mentioned during Sakura Miko’s own countdown stream.</p></p><h2><strong>Expanding Across Southeast Asia: International Support Ads Led by Fans Abroad</strong></h2><p>Support ad projects organized by overseas fans are also thriving. Among the campaigns rolled out in July and August 2025 were those in several places such as Taiwan, South Korea, Malaysia, Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Thailand: in Bangkok, Thailand, ads even appeared on the famous tuk-tuks. South Korea and Taiwan, in particular, have become central hubs for the overseas support ad movement.</p><p>We talked to an organizer of a birthday support ad for Houshou Marine that was put together in Malaysia in collaboration with fans from Taiwan and Hong Kong who explained their motivations for the project: “I wanted to express my gratitude for the energy and smiles Captain Marine brings us every day and contribute, even in just a small way, to the community by creating a support ad that everyone can enjoy. At the same time, I hope more people can understand and appreciate the charm of Captain Marine.”</p><p>The organizer also spoke about the creative side of the project: “We worked with illustrator, Yoshinone Sensei, who is also part of the same Houshou no Ichimi community, on this project because we thought their style matched perfectly with what we had in mind, and we felt it would bring even more excitement to the project.”</p><p>When running support ads overseas, it’s also important to pay attention to cultural sensitivities and local etiquette.</p><p>“Because the ad was going to be displayed in a public space in Malaysia, and there were design restrictions from the advertising company, we had to be very careful in deciding on the design. We were mindful that it would be seen by many people, so we repeatedly checked to make sure the expressions we used were appropriate,” said the representative of the Houshou Marine Birthday &amp; 6th Anniversary Support Ad.</p><p>The Hakos Baelz 4th Anniversary Support Ad, organized by the Taiwanese fan community JDON MY SOUL CLUB, was made possible after crowdfunding targets were reached much sooner than expected. The campaign featured ads in several cities and formats, including a lightbox ad in Taipei, a bus stop ad in Kaohsiung (pictured below), and a wrapped bus in Taichung – all popular locations for support ads.&nbsp;</p><p>Its organizer also reflected on the project: “I learned so much through this experience, from working with vendors and managing schedules to figuring out how to promote the campaign and deal with unexpected challenges.” They added that having other members’ ads displayed nearby created natural opportunities for interaction between fans and project teams, bringing everyone closer together and further strengthening the community.</p><h2><strong>A New Culture Shaped by Fan Creativity: Support Ads Connecting Communities and the Future</strong></h2><p>Unlike traditional advertising, support ads have grown into a new way for fans to express how they feel about their favorite talents. As we heard from project organizers, these ads have become a recognized part of VTuber culture – an extension of UGC that allows the creativity and passion of fans to be seen by all.&nbsp;</p><p>What stands out most about these activities is how they create opportunities for fans who had never met before to connect with one another. Whether it be supporting one another through crowdfunding or sharing project updates on social media, new bonds are created naturally, and in many cases, these connections go beyond a single project and blossom into lasting relationships. Overseas, too, local fans are also organizing support ads, using Discord and social media to collaborate internationally, creating new ways to connect with other like-minded fans that transcend both language and distance.&nbsp;</p><p>The growing presence of support ads shows how fan-driven UGC activities are not only about enjoying content, but also about shaping new cultural movements. At COVER, we expect support advertising to continue to evolve as a new and important way for fans to express their creativity and love as part of their , so we will remain committed to supporting such fan-led initiatives and providing a safe space for fans to continue to create and express themselves.</p><p>hololive production Derivative Works Guidelines</p>","contentLength":14062,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Creating a “New Normal” with VTuber – Insights from a Former Consulting Professional","url":"https://coveredge.cover-corp.com/en/list/3075","date":1758769200,"author":"cover_hirata","guid":1058,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In the Corporate Planning Office, I handle the typical duties you’d expect – budget planning, budget management, and streamlining internal processes.
