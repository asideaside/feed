To be honest, these initiatives stemmed from a strong reflection that, as the organization expands rapidly, the systems in place to support talents were unable to keep up with that growth. Until now, hololive production has grown through close collaboration built on deep, one-on-one relationships of trust between talents and their managers. However, when information is contained solely within these “close relationships,” a challenge emerges: as the scale of activities expanded, it became difficult for the organization as a whole to provide swift backup support. There were, in fact, instances in which delayed the sharing of information, such as that concerning the physical condition of the talents, or the response to unexpected situations, resulted in critical feedback that our responses had been “too slow.” We take such feedback very seriously. By relying too heavily on the passion of those on the ground, a single delay ended up placing a significant burden on talents’ physical and mental well-being, as well as on projects themselves. We are determined not to repeat the regret of feeling like the organization could have acted sooner.The reforms currently underway aim to appropriately visualize information that the organization should share and collaborate on, while maintaining the trusted relationships between talents and their managers. While strictly managing the privacy that must be protected, we are moving quickly to establish a system that allows necessary information to be shared in real time with teams and specialized divisions. The introduction of a database and new coordinator positions are not merely about improving efficiency, but  of our resolve to ensure that the entire organization has an accurate understanding of each talent’s situation, and can swiftly unite to protect and support them when necessary.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[hololive ID 5th Anniversary] Behind the Scenes of “Chromatic Future”: Nine Talents, One Bridge from Indonesia to the World</title><link>https://coveredge.cover-corp.com/en/list/4013</link><author>cover_hirata</author><category>COVER</category><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 03:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://coveredge.cover-corp.com/en">COVEREdge Magazine</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Across hololive production as a whole, many initiatives are designed to reach audiences both inside and outside of Japan. The Japan-based members, for example, aren’t labeled as “JP,” and hololive English is grouped not by geography, but by language. In that context, hololive ID may sometimes be perceived as a group with a more limited regional focus. In reality, however, that isn’t the case at all. One of the defining characteristics of people in Indonesia is that many grow up exposed to multiple languages from an early age, in an environment that readily embraces diverse cultures. hololive ID talents share these same foundations. Their interest in and understanding of different cultures has allowed them to develop a level of fluency in languages such as Indonesian traditional language, and more, and to use these languages naturally across their streams and musical activities. By incorporating multiple languages and cultures, the talents are able to express themselves much more artistically and, because of this underlying potential, I feel that hololive ID has been able to strike a flexible balance between catering to global audiences and local viewers. Their ability to bridge different cultures and values, combined with a high level of adaptability, is perfectly suited for international activities, and I see it as one of hololive ID’s greatest strengths. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[hololive ID 5th Anniversary] The 5-Year Journey of hololive Indonesia</title><link>https://coveredge.cover-corp.com/en/list/3886</link><author>cover_hirata</author><category>COVER</category><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 03:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://coveredge.cover-corp.com/en">COVEREdge Magazine</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In True Indonesian Style Backed by Data: Born from a Nation of YouthThe Southeast Asian archipelago made up of over 17,000 islands that is Indonesia is known for being a “nation of youth” where around half of its population is 29 or younger and is also one of the most multilingual countries in the world with over 700 languages spoken nationwide, characterized by its diverse language and culture. Since the second half of the 1980s, popular Japanese anime has been shown in Indonesia, making it a country with a high awareness of Japanese pop culture for some time now, not just anime.It was into this landscape in April 2020 that the first hololive production VTuber group outside of Japan was born with three talents in Generation 1, with 3 more talents following suit in December of the same year as part of Generation 2, doubling the number of unique talents and with it the fan base grew. At that time, those who were aware of hololive within Indonesia were still only those who consumed Japanese anime and had an interest in Japanese culture. However, through constant streaming and activities from Generation 1 and 2 members, this level of interest steadily grew. Then, when Generation 1 talent Moona Hoshinova’s channel became the first in Southeast Asia to reach 1 million subscribers, everything began to change. VTubers were no longer just “novel content for anime lovers,” but were being recognized as individual streamers as internet culture in Indonesia continued to thrive. It was also at this time that we were able to accumulate data, through the activities of Generation 1 and 2 talents, about what genres and music were well-received among Indonesians. Based on this data, from Generation 3, which debuted in March 2022, onwards, we have reflected Indonesian culture and trends more in our audition methods and visuals. As a result, hololive became far more well-known locally with Kobo Kanaeru following in the footsteps of Moona Hoshinova and Kureiji Ollie, becoming the fastest hololive ID to reach 1 million subscribers on her YouTube channel, reaching the milestone in just four months after her channel was created.  Following on from this, in August 2022, to mark 7 million subscribers across all hololive ID talents, a commemorative advertisement was put up in Senayan Station, part of the Jakarta subway system (MRT Jakarta). hololive ID talents could be seen throughout the city and were becoming a part of daily life in Indonesia. The VTuber boom in Indonesia and the various challenges posed to previous generations gave us crucial insights into what kind of content and activities are commonly enjoyed locally—from music and gaming genres to communication styles. These learnings have not only heavily influenced how the Generation 3 debut project was managed, but also all hololive ID-related decision-making processes regarding offline events and local promotions ever since.Since 2022, hololive ID talents have featured at the annual hololive SUPER EXPO & fes. in Japan, with their incredible singing ability and dance performances a huge hit among fans. In September 2022, the three Generation 1 talents revealed their 3D models on a relay stream, and increased the scope of their activities that included a tour of Asia* in 2023.*International Event: “VRChat Presents viv:ID CRUISE hololive Meet Asia Tour”Respecting Indonesian Culture: An Appeal Born from a Unique IdentitySo, why have hololive ID talents been so well received by viewers in Indonesia and many other parts of the world? We believe that there are a number of reasons for this. The appeal of VTubers that have the support of a global community stems from the talents all having their own strong individuality, and their ability to have bilateral communication with their viewers. hololive ID adapts this characteristic appeal to suit the Indonesian language and culture. In particular, forms of “wrestling-style” communication between talents and viewers are frequent, where Indonesian slang, known as bahasa gaul, and jokes are used to make jibes at each other, bringing about a closer and more friendly form of interaction with local viewers. Many of the hololive ID members are also multilingual allowing them to “code-switch,” whereby they naturally switch between multiple languages during the same stream, making the group particularly unique with its ambiguous geographical and linguistic boundaries, endearing itself with not only the Indonesian public, but with Japanese and Western fans as well.These strengths are evident in the content of talents’ streams, their fan communities and, above all, their original music.On the musical front, songs like Kobo Kanaeru’s “Oh! Asmara” and Moona Hoshinova’s “Perisai Jitu” are characterized by their Indonesian pop influences, making them highly acclaimed locally in Indonesia. These songs have transcended the VTuber fan base and become huge hits, making waves on the national music streaming charts. On the other hand, other songs feature a blend of multiple languages such as English and Japanese and are being released with a more global audience in mind.The presence of both an approachability stemming from local influences to a universality which resonates with a global audience is what makes hololive ID so unique. hololive ID, with its uniquely Indonesian languages and culture as well as its boldness and individuality that connects with a global audience, has seen its fan base continue to grow, not only within Indonesia but far and wide throughout Japan, South Asia and North America, blossoming into a group boasting diversity even within the production. Each and every talent of hololive ID has been a pioneer in bringing Indonesian culture and VTubers to the global market. Some fans may remember the oddity of anime-looking characters speaking Indonesian in the beginning when hololive ID first became active as a group, but the talents’ efforts to stay true to their culture and values while continuing to produce content that can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of nationality may just be what has made hololive ID so  uniquely appealing. Since 2023, the group’s activities have diversified even further through offline events and collaborations with other companies. February 2023 saw all 9 affiliated talents reveal their new kimono outfits on a relay stream, and then in August, they announced their VRChat Presents viv:ID CRUISE hololive Meet Asia Tour, with 4 of the members touring Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and New York. This saw a steady increase in offline engagement with fans, with appearances by ID talents at both hololive STAGE World Tour’24 -Soar!-  and hololive STAGE World Tour ’25 -Synchronize!- in 2024 and 2025, showcasing their global presence.Collaborations and campaigns domestically with Indonesian businesses have also been well-received. Kureiji Ollie and Kobo Kanaeru made an appearance in a promotion for the staple instant noodles Indomie from Indonesian food/beverage giant Indofood, which originally came about by the brand simply being mentioned on stream, enabling the presence of VTubers to be more widely known outside of original fan communities.  Kobo Kanaeru also appeared in a commercial for the Honda BeAT, a popular scooter in Indonesia. A fusion of live-action and 3D elements, the commercial was nominated at the YouTube Works Awards Southeast Asia 2025, winning Best Collaboration: Brand & Creator. On top of this, 2025 also saw a domestic collaboration with Pocky. hololive ID has played a considerable role in not only promoting local companies within the Indonesian market through such campaigns as receiving hololive ID photo cards when purchasing products, but has worked with international companies achieving similar success as well.In November 2025, numerous fans gathered at Comic Frontier 21 ICE BSD Hall 6 for hololive Indonesia 5th Anniversary live Chromatic Future, the group’s first-ever concert in Indonesia featuring all hololive ID members to celebrate its 5-year anniversary, which was a resounding success. Five years on, hololive ID has been a social phenomenon going beyond the realm of entertainment; a success story in the digital creation industry in Indonesia made through successes had in music streaming charts and collaborations with other brands. Moving forward, we are looking to expand activities based in Indonesia even further while continuing to collaborate even closer with the entire hololive production.In the second part of this series, we will bring you interviews with event staff who worked on the hugely successful hololive Indonesia 5th Anniversary LIVE Chromatic Future, and share some of the ideas and sentiments that went into the production.https://coveredge.cover-corp.com/en/list/4013[hololive ID 5th Anniversary] Behind the Scenes of “Chromatic Future”: Nine Talents, One Bridge from Indonesia to the World | COVERedgeLaunched in 2020 as the overseas branch of hololive, hololive Indonesia (hereinafter “hololive ID”) has since expanded its activities beyond Southeast Asia to Japan and English-speaking regions around the world. In November 2025, hololive Indonesia marked its fifth anniversary with a special commemorative concert, “hololive Indonesia 5th Anniversary LIVE Chromatic Future (hereinafter “Chromatic Future”). Chromatic Future took place as part of the Indonesian creator convention Comic Frontier, bringing together all nine members from hololive ID’s three generations for a special joint performance. In addition to the concert itself, the event also offered “hololive Indonesia Fan Festival” a special booth exhibition zone dedicated to hololive ID.
