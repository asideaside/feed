The more we want God to exist, the more we must question so-called ‘proofs’ of God’s existence. God likely appreciates skeptics, those who genuinely seek and genuinely doubt. Skeptics provide real service: they help clear up or clean out poor arguments for God. Is it possible all the ‘God arguments’ are bad?

What is the extent of God’s creation? If there are multiple universes, did God create each of them? If an infinite number of universes, did God create all of them? Theists may be conflicted: the centrality of human beings in this one universe, and, for Christians, the incarnation on Earth, versus the magnification of God with multiple universes.

‘A new heaven and a new earth’ is the grand vision of the Bible. The Judeo-Christian scriptures tell of a future time when all things shall be made new. What could this mean? Does ‘all’ include the entire cosmos? Multiple universes, if there are such? Could such an ancient vision ever make sense? Believers say, “It’s God’s mystery.” They should say more.

Metaphysics is the deepest probe of reality. It is the branch of philosophy that discerns the most general features of the world. When focused on God, metaphysics seeks insights not readily apparent, such as possible contradictions (or coherence) among various traits of God. Other topics include tensions between God and time, and God and abstract objects.

Conflicting religions fill the world. Doctrines about God contradict one another. No one denies the diversity of religions and the apparent incompatibility of their core beliefs. Many believe only their own religion to be the truth. Some claim all religions reflect the same truth. Others assert that differing dogmas expose the emptiness of all religion.

For God to be God, God must be infallible and know the future perfectly, including all my actions from birth to death. For my will to be free, my actions must not be constrained. But if God knows the future – if God literally knows now what I am going to do later – then how are my actions later not constrained? How then free will?

Great art is transcendent. Its impact reaches far beyond the art itself and the person who created it. Art can help us perceive reality in new ways and give new meaning to the physical world around us. But what makes art—from music and dance to sculpture and architecture—truly transcendent?

Why is an ‘open’ future controversial among theologians? If the future is not ‘settled’, if there is no certainty from God’s viewpoint of how future events will turn out, then God’s providence, could not be as sure. If the future is truly open, then not even God could know the future because there are no future facts to know.

Agnostics do not know whether or not God exists. Theists surmise they’re reprobates. Atheists suppose they’re cowards. Are there different kinds of agnostics? Can agnosticism deepen appreciation for God—what it would take to believe in God and what it would mean if indeed there were a God? A robust, energetic agnosticism is a credit to God if there is one.

To do good theology, religion must speak with science if only to avoid the embarrassment of supernatural explanations when natural explanations are doing just fine. If religion claims to be an approach to the entirety of existence, then it must embed the discoveries and insights of science. Religion has no choice. At its own risk, religion ignores science.
