Humanity is facing serious disputes over our most important resource. What impact is our lifestyle having on our planet's water cycles?

Along six rivers on four continents, the documentary explores the question of why this vital resource, water, is becoming increasingly scarce - and who’s responsible. 70 per cent of fresh water is used in agriculture. And a large proportion of this goes into the production of animal feed. Our excessive meat consumption is partly to blame for the fact that mighty rivers such as the Spanish Ebro or the Colorado in the USA and Mexico are drying up. Factory farming businesses are worth billions to major agricultural companies, but this overuse of water often goes hand in hand with its pollution. Europe has outsourced its dirtiest industries to countries such as India. Around 20 per cent of global water pollution is caused by the textile industry. The film provides rare insights into Indian factories and life in the places where contaminants are discharged.

But it’s not all bad news. In the film, we also meet people who’ve come up with solutions. In France, dams are dismantled to revitalize rivers; in an Egyptian oasis the inhabitants experiment with hydroponics; and in India, an individual known as the "water man” uses a millennia-old technique to coax rivers from deserts that dried up decades ago.

They’re a type of wetland, basically an ecosystem that is covered in water. But the water in peatlands doesn’t have much oxygen, which keeps dead organic matter from breaking down completely. 🌱 
 
That’s great news for the climate! Instead of releasing a bunch of CO2 during decomposition, peatlands store all that carbon in a wet and mossy vault. 🔒 
 
But the stored CO2 can be easily released again if the peatlands are destroyed or dried up. 🏭

ABSTRACT
In this explore the past, present and future of array programming languages. They are one of the most expressive and productive languages yet remain relatively unknown.T hey are still used heavily in financial markets globally. Array developers made the first wide spread use of learning by katas and patterns, then called idioms, and including the now pervasive map reduce. The dynamic Array languages originated with APL followed by APL2, NIAL, J and k.

Often considered high barrier languages, we argue that they are much like a challenging instrument that when mastered allow to make amazing music with seeming little effort. We will also discuss why Vector programming is a natural low impedance approach for dealing with today’s high performance NoSQL and NewSQL column stores.

In the late 60s and early 70s Fortran, Lisp, COBOL, APL and Basic were the hot languages. Lisp, APL and later Basic pioneered the “the repl” of interactive computing. APL provides an efficient array/vector language for numeric computing. and found wide acceptance in financial, engineering and statistical computing. APL inspired – the Smalltalk environment; array extensions in other general languages such as Python NumPy and NamedTuple; F-Script for IOS Cocoa; special purpose languages such as MatLab and R; to recent proposed extensions for value types in Java; along with special purpose vector hardware like GPUs and recent Intel AVX instructions.

Birth rates are plummeting worldwide – and while this might seem like nothing new – as it has been the case in developed countries for quite some time. The thing that is interesting is that we are seeing declining birth rates everywhere and the standard explanations that you have heard in the past don’t really hold up.

Sometimes a Landscape painting is anything but a painting of a landscape. 

This is a film about José María Velasco, an artist who specialised in incredibly detailed landscapes, and was once a household name - but now is practically unknown outside the country of his birth, Mexico.

When thinking about Mexican nationalism and cultural identity, figures like Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera often take centre stage. Their iconic works have become synonymous with Mexican art. However, Velasco’s landscapes, particularly The Valley of Mexico, are often overlooked in these discussions.

Male circumcision is done for religious, cultural or medical reasons.

In Africa, the WHO used male circumcision in the fight against AIDS. But more and more doctors say that the harm done by the procedure outweighs any medical benefits, and that this surgery is performed far too often.
Those affected are increasingly daring to go public, demanding that boys, too, be protected from circumcisions that are not medically necessary. Advocates say their right to physical integrity must be preserved. 
But few take it as far as Florian. He’s sure that his circumcision as a child wasn’t medically necessary. Moreover, his parents were not informed about alternative options. He’s taking his case to court.
The film explores the question of when circumcision actually makes  medical sense, and critically questions the ethics of this millennia-old practice.

Two years of heavy rainfall spurred rapid vegetation growth, only for eight months of extreme drought to transform that vegetation into a tinderbox. When high winds swept through, all it took was a spark for LA to ignite.

ABSTRACT
Why are companies quietly using languages like Elm, OCaml, and Haskell?

No development department gets in trouble for going with industry standard languages, but that also means there is sometimes space to gain a considerable advantage over your competetion through language selection.

Drawing from notable success stories like Jane Street, Standard Chartered, Corvus, and Vendr, we will evaluate typed functional languages from a business perspective: What are the concrete business advantages gained by the companies using typed functional languages? When are these advantages likely (and unlikely) to translate to other businesses? And how can a business responsibly evaluate if the same advantages are available in their particular case? [...]

The story begins a few weeks after the death of Jina Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish student who died on 16 September 2022.

She had allowed a few strands of hair to escape from her veil. Members of the Iranian morality police beat her so severely that she died of her injuries. The regime in Tehran has denied all responsibility for her death, which triggered nationwide mass protests under a slogan that echoed all around the world: "Woman, Life, Freedom”.

Iranian filmmaker Shorresh Afkari filmed in secret, smuggling the footage out of the country to a colleague in France. His documentary gives a voice to people who, like large sections of the Iranian population, have run out of strength and patience.

For example, the film observes a young couple who dream of being able to express their love openly and in complete freedom. We also meet a taxi driver, who ends up in prison as a bitter opponent of the regime. His mother tries to protect him at all costs. A painter continues to practise her art despite censorship; a doctor secretly treats demonstrators. A young man is prepared to do anything for cash, even sell one of his kidneys. Just like men who dare to protest, women who show their hair in public and publicly oppose the regime still face harsh punishment, including the death penalty. For this reason, many interviewees speak off-camera to protect their anonymity.

Dublin is particularly affected. The few properties that are left can only be rented at extremely high prices. Fewer and fewer people can afford to live in the city. 

Not only are rents increasing, so is homelessness. Ireland’s housing market has been a problem since the 2008 financial crisis.

DESCRIPTION
Sarah Wells and Anne Currie dive into “The Cloud Native Attitude” and uncover why it’s more than just using cloud infrastructure. It’s about breaking bottlenecks, embracing rapid change, and aligning the entire organization.

Anne reflects on how Kubernetes has risen since the book’s first edition, but the core principles remain. They discuss why CI/CD is key, how cloud native supports sustainability, and why true transformation demands more than just a lift-and-shift. The conversation wraps up with practical advice on identifying real bottlenecks and securing buy-in for a successful cloud native journey.

Born in Kansas City, she earned an honors degree in international relations at Northwestern and studied piano in Paris before teaching French poetry at the University of California, Berkeley. Though she reflects on the loneliness of outliving her friends, she embraces life with laughter—like on her joyride through Oakland’s vibrant neighborhoods near her home at Piedmont Gardens.

JOYRIDE is a short-form interview series that pairs younger generations with older adults as they explore the world together on trishaw bikes. The show is inspired by the global non-profit, Cycling Without Age, which takes older adults on trishaw outings to feel the wind in their hair. From the Santa Barbara coastline to Barcelona beaches, each episode unlocks the lived experiences of today’s older generation, who have become increasingly removed from the flow of daily life. This series will create new conditions for generations to collide, share experiences, and be inspired by a sense of place and nostalgia.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How One War Changed EVERYTHING</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2scuzvMHv14</link><author>Imperial War Museums</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/2scuzvMHv14?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 15:06:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3uAjWoLZ4bSi6qI9SjALxA">Imperial War Museums</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On the 28th of February 1991, the Gulf War came to an end. But a new conflict, was about to begin.  
The following day, US President Bush made a statement to the people of Iraq. "In my view… the Iraqi people should put Saddam aside”. At the very  same time, Shia in the south and Kurds in the north took control of much of the country. Saddam’s regime was on the ropes. But the uprisings would end in disaster. 

In this final episode of our Gulf War series, we’ll explore the aftermath of the war. Why did the uprisings fail? Why didn’t the Coalition intervene? And how did the Gulf War set the stage for the 2003 invasion of Iraq?

While social media has helped tourism boom and brought prosperity to the region, it also poses a threat to the landscape and its unique historical heritage.

Cappadocia draws more than four million tourists every year. The region in Turkey is famous for its extraordinary "fairy chimneys" - carved-out boulders, some of which are still inhabited. This wonderland became a UNESCO World Heritage Site decades ago.
Every day, hot air balloons carrying tourists drift across valleys dotted with "fairy chimneys." The rock formations, the hot air balloons, the sunrise - the setting couldn't be more instagrammable.
Mustafa Köse knows exactly how to get the perfect shot that tourists want for their social media posts. "Cultural tourism is dead," the photographer says - all people want now is something to show off with on Instagram. It's a development he struggles with, even though he makes a decent living giving the tourists what they want. 
Zehra Demircan took over her father's "cave hotel" a couple of years ago. He did his best to preserve the family's "fairy chimneys" in their original state so that the accommodation still provides an authentic glimpse of Cappadocia. Zehra Demircan is following suit, modernizing the hotel as carefully as possible. Like Mustafa Köse, she sometimes feels conflicted about her visitors. "We had a group here who didn't visit anything for the entire week," she says. "The whole time, they just took photos for social media."
Local activist Mükremin Tokmak has been fighting for years against the destruction of this unique landscape. He was appalled by the construction of a highway cutting through the historical region, paving the way for even more tourism. He documents the effects of the construction work on the valleys and the old churches that stood here. He hasn't given up hope that tourism can be held in check.
