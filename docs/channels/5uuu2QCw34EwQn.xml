His positive view of the Kremlin’s leader was only matched by Carlson’s description of Witkoff as “the most effective American diplomat in a generation.”Talking about his two meetings with Putin on Feb. 11 and March 13, Witkoff said “I liked him. I think he was honest with me.”Carlson said that assessment was shared by “all the presidents in the world” including Joe Biden: “They may not agree with what Russia is doing, but they say: ‘You know, Putin is an open person,’” Carlson said.Witkoff, in response to criticism of the bilateral meetings with Russia, said that as the “president’s emissary” he had been tasked with attempts to restore [US-Russian] relations and to start productive discussion on “how to end this conflict.”It's a complicated situation, this war, and all the components that led to it. You know, it's never just one person who's right.He said that Putin had criticized the Biden administration’s refusal to enter in dialogue. “President Putin said to me at our first meeting: ‘How do we resolve a conflict with the head of a major nuclear power if we don’t establish trust and good relations with each other? … I haven’t spoken to Joe Biden in three and a half years’,” Witkoff said.He summed up his meetings with Putin as the first steps in what will become “a good, healthy conversation” between the two countries saying: “President Putin, to his credit, has sent every signal to President Trump that this is the path he wants to take.”In addition to describing Putin as “not a bad person,” Witkoff said: “It’s a complicated situation, this war, and all the components that led to it. You know, it’s never just one person who’s right.”Witkoff added that after the July 13 assassination attempt against Trump, Putin went to church and prayed for him: “… not because he could be the president of the United States, but because they had a friendship, and he prayed for his friend.” He added telling Trump of this, “He [Trump] was clearly touched.”If there is a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia the consensus is that Ukraine cannot be a member of NATO.In speaking about the situation on the battlefield Witkoff repeated the contentions that Ukrainian troops have been surrounded in Russia’s Kursk region – despite the claim being contradicted by the Ukrainian authorities, independent experts, and even US intelligence assessments.He added that Putin told him Kursk wasn’t the only instance where his troops had surrounded and isolated Kyiv’s forces.“President Putin told me that: ‘… the Ukrainians have people trapped there [Kursk]’... he then asked: ‘What should I do in this or that area where we have people surrounded and they don’t want to surrender? Should I kill them? How can I make them surrender? I’m happy not to kill everyone. I’m happy to make people wave a white flag if I can make them.’”Asked about Ukraine’s aspiration to join NATO (and Moscow’s declaration this would be an unacceptable red line) or failing that to at least be offered “Article 5 protection,” Witkoff said:“I think [Ukraine’s president] Zelensky and his right-hand man Yermak, have pretty much accepted that Ukraine will not become a member of NATO. There has been a lot of talk about whether they could have Article 5 protection… from the US or from European countries without being a member of NATO? I think that’s open to debate… but… If there is a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia the consensus is that Ukraine cannot be a member of NATO.”If the world recognizes these [five regions] as Russian territories, will this end [the war] and will Zelensky survive politically if he recognizes this?Asked by Carlson about European fears that if Russia “wins” in Ukraine Putin would “want to march on Europe,” Witkoff simply replied “100% no.” He then went further saying he didn’t believe Moscow wanted to “absorb” the whole of Ukraine:“… The Russians have what they want: They got back these five regions. They have Crimea. They got what they wanted. So what else do they want?” He then went on to say that the main ongoing problem to resolving the war is the issue of [the occupied] territories.In another echo of the Kremlin propaganda line Witkoff said that the “Russian speaking residents” of these regions [Crimea, Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson] had overwhelmingly indicated they wanted to be part of the Russian Federation in referendums – a process that most of the world thinks were not only illegal but were held under occupation, subject to coercion (sometimes at gunpoint) and falsification in the absence of independent observers.He then mentioned, what he called “the elephant in the room” - Ukrainian constitutional issues that prevented the ceding of territories despite being under de facto Russian control and then asked the question: “If the world recognizes these [five regions] as Russian territories, will this end [the war] and will Zelensky survive politically if he recognizes this?”Needless to say, international media and analysts expressed concern (in the case of Ukrainian media outrage) that Witkoff’s commentary seemed to spout almost verbatim Putin’s avowed red lines for peace, was filled with half-truths and reiterated many of “Moscow’s lies.”In particular, his assertion that the remaining obstacle to peace was the future of (and Kyiv’s agreement to give up) the occupied territories. He seemed to suggest that these should remain as part of Russia, including by implication, those parts of the contested regions that remain under Ukrainian control. In general, comments on Ukrainian social media expressed fears for the country’s future as the US continues to “hand over the keys to the kingdom” before negotiations proper have even started.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>China is considering deploying a contingent to Ukraine</title><link>https://unn.ua/en/amp/china-is-considering-deploying-a-contingent-to-ukraine-media</link><author>/u/Antique-Entrance-229</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 16:00:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Diplomats from Beijing have asked the EU to participate in peacekeeping forces in Ukraine. There is hope that Russia will take action if China participates in the mission. This was reported by Welt, citing EU diplomatic circles, reports . China is apparently considering participating in a possible peacekeeping force in Ukraine. Chinese diplomats in Brussels have been probing the question of whether such a step would be conceivable and possibly even desirable from Europe's point of view Diplomatic circles in Brussels said: "The inclusion of China in the "coalition of the willing" could potentially strengthen Russia's agreement to the presence of peacekeeping forces in Ukraine." In any case, the issue is "sensitive."French President Emmanuel Macron has announced another summit of supporters of Ukraine next Thursday. "Next Thursday we will hold a summit of the coalition of the willing," Macron said Thursday evening after the EU summit in Brussels. "My goal on Thursday is, first of all, a renewed, clear and possibly somewhat more concrete commitment to support Ukraine in the short term."Macron added that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will also attend the summit in Paris. Both Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer are ready to deploy peacekeepers to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire between Moscow and Kyiv - an idea that, according to Welt, Russia has so far categorically rejected. Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Georgiy Tykhyi reported that several countries have officially stated their readiness to send military contingents to Ukraine, and a corresponding list has already been formed.On March 20, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that there is currently a different vision regarding the military contingent for Ukraine, because there are countries that are ready to provide it in the event of a repeated aggression by the Russian Federation, there are those who agree to be located on the border, and there are those who want only at sea or in central large cities. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a common vision.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Levittown: The battle against deepfakes</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdvubBk_wqg</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/gdvubBk_wqg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 15:30:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When dozens of young women discover manipulated photos of themselves on a porn site, they fight back - joining a global battle against deepfakes.

It now needs to be published in the federal law gazette.Expenditures on defense, intelligence services, and cybersecurity exceeding 1% of GDP will be exempt from the debt rule. Importantly, this also unlocks the allocation of 3 billion euros in military aid to Ukraine.According to the approved law, 500 billion euros could be allocated for infrastructure investments over the next 12 years. The federal states are required to use 100 billion euros for their own infrastructure, 300 billion euros will be transferred to the German government, and the remaining 100 billion euros will be allocated for climate protection.German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock welcomed this decision and emphasized its critical importance as the situation in Ukraine continues to worsen. She added that Ukraine urgently needs more surface-to-air missiles, artillery ammunition, spare parts, and weapon systems.Germany is one of Ukraine's main allies and leaders in providing military assistance. Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, Berlin has provided the Ukrainian army with tanks of various modifications, artillery, armored vehicles, shells, ammunition, and other weaponry.Germany has also provided Ukraine with means to enhance its air defense, including the latest IRIS-T and Patriot missile systems.However, Germany has yet to approve the transfer of long-range Taurus cruise missiles, which Ukraine has requested.

Martial law imposed in Ukraine at the outset of Russia’s full-scale invasion prohibits the country from holding elections.The Dutch community page that called on people to participate in the protest claimed the event was “coordinated by Ukrainian refugees.” Strangely enough, it appears there were no Ukrainians at the gathering.Of the eight demonstrators who showed up in Amsterdam, five were Dutch and two were Russian. The identity of one remains unverified by the Kyiv Independent.Without attracting much attention on the streets, participants quietly unfolded their placards bearing blunt and provocative messages: “Ukraine is evil for Dutch taxpayers” and “Zelensky! Stop killing your people!” Another read “Sponsoring Kiev is sponsoring terrorism against Ukrainians,” using the Russian spelling for Ukraine’s capital city Kyiv. No Ukrainian flags were seen at the protest, despite the organizers’ claim that Ukrainians had coordinated the event. The only country flag present was Russian, with the words “Peace with Russia” written on it.Protesters took turns posing with different posters. The messages on the posters warned of war between NATO and Russia, calling for a Ukraine without Zelensky, blaming Zelensky for Russia’s full-scale invasion, and demanding the end of “forced mobilization” in Ukraine.While a small event, the gathering was part of a larger anti-Ukraine movement posing as a peace initiative that has been ongoing for over two years.Network of Dutch RussiansAfter the onset of Russia’s full-scale invasion, a group of Dutch activists took to the streets in response to what they perceived as the establishment and media inciting warmongering and hatred toward Russia. Since February 2023, the group, which operates under the name “Vredesdemonstratie” meaning “Peace Demonstration” in Dutch, has been holding monthly protests. At these events, demonstrators advocate for ending military aid for Ukraine — who they blame for the war along with NATO — and making peace with Russia. Their banners usually feature phrases such as “No weapons for peace” or “Peace with Russia” in both Dutch and English. The foreign military aid, including assistance from the Netherlands, which the group so passionately opposes, has been critical to Ukraine’s ability to defend itself from Russia’s invasion. Among individual countries, the Netherlands ranks fifth in total military aid, contributing 5.88 billion euros between Jan. 24, 2022, and Dec. 31, 2024, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, which tracks aid to Ukraine. Although they present themselves as a movement of “pacifist idealists,” members of Peace Demonstration make their demands solely of Ukraine and its supporters, and never of Russia.The reason for this approach becomes clear as soon as one looks at the composition of the participants: many of the most active protesters at these rallies are Dutch Russians — migrants of Russian origin who settled in the Netherlands long ago. Some have lived in the Netherlands for over 20 years. The group’s demonstrations often feature Russian flags and sometimes include cultural performances, such as singing traditional songs, dancing, and wearing traditional attire.Despite their clear ties to Russian culture, the protesters never identify as being members of the Russian diaspora. It appears that they purposefully keep the origin of the protests blurry, trying to pass the events as Dutch or Ukrainian. Among those posing with a Russian flag in a recent photo-op protest was Natalia Vorontsova, also known as Nata Heezen. As a co-organizer, she is a key figure in nearly every Peace Demonstration event.Originally from Russia’s southwestern city of Voronezh, Vorontsova has lived in the Netherlands for over 20 years. She works as a nurse in mental health care.Alongside fellow activists Nikita Ananjev and Elena Plotnikova, she has been lobbying for Russian interests in the Netherlands since 2014, the year when Russia invaded Ukraine’s Crimea and the eastern part of Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.Campaigning in the NetherlandsIn 2016, Vorontsova joined a campaign organized by the Dutch Socialist Party that brought together a group of Russians and Ukrainians with pro-Russian views to advocate against Ukraine’s European integration in a Dutch referendum.Despite a low turnout of 32.2%, Dutch voters rejected the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement. The vote was non-binding and did not overturn the agreement, which had already been ratified by the other 27 EU member states.Alongside Vorontsova, two other prominent campaigners were Nikita Ananjev — a Russian who formerly chaired the Russian Student Association in the Netherlands — and Elena Plotnikova, who describes herself on X as a “Russian from Donetsk,” a Ukrainian city that has been under occupation since 2014. Three years later, in 2019, all three were involved in another organization — the Dutch branch of the Global Rights of Peaceful People (GRPP) international platform, which has advocated for Russian-controlled forces in eastern Ukraine. Ananjev is introduced in one of the platform’s videos as the president of the Dutch Committee of GRPP, while Plotnikova managed the organization’s email correspondence. The GRPP is deregistered from the Dutch Chamber of Commerce. It is not known why its registration was canceled. GRPP organized a press conference aimed at discrediting an official investigation conducted by the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) into the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 in eastern Ukraine. According to the JIT’s conclusions, Russia's military delivered a Buk missile fired by Russian-controlled militants in July 2014, killing all 298 people on board, including 196 Dutch citizens.At the press conference, where Vorontsova served as host, a documentary by a former Russia Today journalist Yana Yerlashova and a Dutch blogger Max van der Werff was presented. The film seeks to discredit the official MH17 investigation and deny Russia’s responsibility for the plane’s downing.The film’s creators are best known for their involvement with Bonanza Media, a project widely regarded as part of the Kremlin’s disinformation efforts. A joint investigation by Bellingcat and The Insider revealed evidence that Bonanza Media coordinated with Russia’s military intelligence service (known by its Russian acronym GRU) to downplay Russia’s involvement in the MH17 downing. Investigators also discovered that Plotnikova was involved with Bonanza Media.Today, it appears, Vorontsova’s main focus is solely on co-organizing Peace Demonstration events in the Netherlands where she’s one of the key faces and voices heard.She maintains close ties with Russian state media, including TASS and RIA Novosti, whose correspondents often attend the demonstrations and interview Vorontsova for their articles. The published materials are later reshared by Vorontsova in the online groups for protest participants. While their demonstrations attract little attention from the Dutch media, they receive extensive coverage in Russia, making them seem like a large-scale movement.Meanwhile, Plotnikova remains active primarily on social media and within the Peace Demonstration community. In 2023, she delivered a speech at one of the demonstrations.Embracing conspiratorial narratives about “NATO missiles killing civilians,” Vorontsova’s demonstrations attract individuals from both far-left and far-right populist circles, united by their pro-Russian sentiment. The pool of guest speakers ranges from communists in anti-fascist movements to MPs from the Dutch far-right party Forum for Democracy (FvD).An investigation by the Dutch newspaper NRC found that Vorontsova may have received funding for her activities from Volunteers of Victory — a Russian government-funded organization that glorifies Russian military patriotism during World War II and supports Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine. Despite Volunteers of Victory being sanctioned by the EU, its Dutch branch Victory Team 75 Netherlands remains active by operating unofficially and avoiding formal registration.In a conversation with the Kyiv Independent, Vorontsova denied any involvement with the Dutch branch of Volunteers of Victory, stating that she had only worn a cap with the organization’s logo that she received as a gift, but had no connection to the group. She also emphasized that she is an independent activist, acts on her own, and is not financially supported by anyone. According to Vorontsova, she finances the demonstrations with donations from supporters.Another participant of the February photo shoot in Amsterdam, Iolanta DuCroix, also known as Klimaite Bardash, appears in several photos on the Instagram page of the local branch of Volunteers of Victory. A Russian-born resident of the Netherlands, DuCroix assisted Vorontsova in holding a Russian flag during the photo shoot.Another participant, Nikita Ananjev, is also a prominent figure in the Russian Volunteers of Victory movement. Known as a coordinator of the Dutch branch, he seems to be present at nearly every one of the organization’s events. He was also a representative of the Coordination Council of Russian Compatriots in the Netherlands, an organization that works closely with the Russian embassy.After Russia’s full-scale invasion, Ananjev openly expressed pro-Putin views. On his page on Vkontakte — a Russian social media platform — he reposted an image stating: "Kyiv will either be Russian or deserted. And we're fine with it being deserted too."When asked about her cooperation with Ananjev, given his active involvement with organizations affiliated with Russia, Vorontsova told the Kyiv Independent that she has not seen Ananjev in years nor collaborated with him on any activities since they were both part of the Dutch branch of the International Platform Global Rights of Peaceful People (GRPP).A Ukrainian defector and a Soviet-era emigrantAlthough Peace Demonstration’s messaging appears to reflect Russian interests, its members claim that Ukrainians are also among their representatives.After analyzing dozens of participants in the group’s demonstrations, the Kyiv Independent found only one Ukrainian who actually spoke in person at their protests. The group’s website and social media present the supposed Ukrainian representative as “Elena from Kiev,” using the Russian spelling for both her name and Ukraine’s capital. In reality, “Elena from Kiev” has not lived in Ukraine since the 1990s, having spent several years in Afghanistan before settling in the Netherlands, according to an interview she gave to AlternatiefTV in August 2023. Her experience of Ukraine is limited to the Soviet era. Like other participants in the rallies, Elena’s views, as she expressed them in the interview with Alternatief TV, align with a line of Kremlin propaganda that insists Ukrainians and Russians are "the same people.” This view is widely rejected in Ukraine. A 2022 poll found that 91% of Ukrainians do not consider Russia and Ukraine to be “one people.”Two other Ukrainians appeared at the demonstrations via video message, supposedly from Russia. One of them, Dmitry Vasilets, is a pro-Kremlin propaganda blogger. In 2024, he was sentenced in absentia by a Ukrainian court to five years in prison for justifying Russia's aggression against Ukraine, as well as advocating for a violent overthrow of the government.Vasilet’s criminal record dates back to 2017 when he was convicted of facilitating the broadcast of a Russian propaganda channel in Russian-occupied parts of eastern Ukraine. He spent two years in a pre-trial detention center in Ukraine.According to Ukrainian law enforcement, eleven days before Russia's full-scale invasion, he fled Ukraine for Egypt and later settled in Moscow, where he declared himself the secretary of the so-called “Representative Office of the Ukrainian People” — a body not recognized by Ukraine.At Vorontsova’s demonstrations, Vasilets appears on the LED screen, calling himself a leader of the Ukrainian party Derzhava in exile. However, Derzhava was banned in Ukraine in 2022 due to its ties to Russia and was so unpopular that it never gained parliamentary representation. During its only attempt to get into parliament in 2006 as part of the "State-Labor Union" bloc, it earned just 0.14% of the vote.Moreover, the Peace Demonstration group also claimed to have Ukrainian independent press at one of their press conferences but did not specify which outlet. The Kyiv Independent found only one non-Dutch media platform covering the event — Vasilets’ pro-Russian Telegram channel, Mriya. The biography of the second Ukrainian, who participated virtually in events organized by Peace Demonstrations in the Netherlands, is no less vivid and far from Ukraine.Judging by the social media posts of Peace Demonstration the international pro-Russian photo shoots appear to be coordinated by another Moscow-based organization, the Union of Political Emigrants and Political Prisoners of Ukraine.Its spokesperson, Leonid Ilderkin, is mentioned in posts related to a previous international pro-Russian campaign that features almost identical scripted messages promoting anti-NATO and anti-Zelensky messages.Ilderkin appeared in a video message for Peace Demonstrations as a so-called “Ukrainian opposition figure in exile.” In the video, he blames the U.S. and Europe for Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.A native of Dnipro, Ukraine, Ilderkin was previously an activist in the pro-Russian communist organization Borotba, meaning “struggle” in Ukrainian. When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, Borotba members supported the occupation of eastern Ukraine, with some even taking up arms on the Russian side. After fleeing Ukraine that same year, the group now operates from Russia and recently participated in an event titled the International Anti-fascist Forum in Russian-occupied Luhansk Oblast. According to documents obtained by the independent Russian anti-corruption project Dossier Center, Russia's military intelligence agency (known by its Russian acronym GRU) attempted to use organizations linked to Ilderkin to coordinate with the European radical left and recruit individuals for protests and acts of sabotage. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify this information.The Union of Political Emigrants and Political Prisoners of Ukraine, which has been given a platform by Dutch demonstrations, consists of pro-Russian fugitives.Among them is Mykola Azarov, Ukraine’s former prime minister under Kremlin-backed President Viktor Yanukovych, who was ousted following the EuroMaidan Revolution in 2014. Azarov participated in a meeting organized by the Union of Political Emigrants in late 2016.Russian demonstration network in EuropeAlthough the Union of Political Emigrants and Political Prisoners of Ukraine has little media presence and minimal influence on social media, it supports other pro-Russian demonstrations beyond the Netherlands.For instance, a so-called “Ukrainian political prisoner” from the union addressed pro-Russian demonstrators in the U.K. online from Moscow in August 2024. The “political prisoner” in the video address is the Union’s chairwoman, Larisa Shesler. She is wanted by Ukrainian law enforcement for “undermining Ukraine’s territorial integrity.”  Shesler, a Ukrainian, played a key role in undermining pro-European protests in the Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv in 2013-2014. She coordinated the local anti-protest movement and organized pro-Russian rallies before eventually fleeing to Russia.The Kyiv Independent found out and verified that she had obtained Russian citizenship.Shesler’s video message to the British pro-Russian demonstrations was picked up and promoted by Theo Russell from the U.K.-based International Ukraine Anti-Fascist Solidarity movement. Russell, a British activist, is also involved in the Dutch organization Peace Demonstration, having spoken at events and frequently posted in community groups.Meanwhile, the YouTube channel Chega Serna English, which has been sharing videos of “Ukrainian political prisoners,” posts footage from pro-Russian rallies in cities like Washington, D.C., Sacramento, Paris, and notably Amsterdam. The footage reveals a recurring pattern — consistent messaging, tone, and symbols, including Soviet and Russian flags. A unifying theme runs through these rallies: a push to end military aid to Ukraine, a critical lifeline for its defense. This mirrors what was seen in Amsterdam.Russian influence in Europe remains strong, backed by a vast network of pro-Kremlin actors, some of whom are hiding behind Ukrainian names.Hi, I’m Linda Hourani, the author of this story.

“I can’t guarantee anything,” Bessent said in an interview Tuesday with Fox Business’ Maria Bartiromo, dismissing any question about assuring there won’t be one as “silly.”

Economists have warned there’s rising risk of an economic downturn thanks in part to uncertainty over President Donald Trump’s tariff hikes, and to worries over their impact once the levies are decided on and implemented.

Campbell Harvey, professor of finance at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business, explains how the Trump-led trade war will likely manifest itself in markets and in US policy going forward. Professor Harvey speaks with Tom Keene and Paul Sweeney on Bloomberg Radio.

"One aspect of that is we need builders and it's part of the reason why earlier today we've brought back the level of the capital gains so that those who take those risks get the rewards."Temporarily waiving the one-week employment insurance waiting period.Temporarily allowing businesses to defer corporate income-tax payments and GST and HST remittances.Deploying a new financing facility (the Large Enterprise Economic and National Security Facility).Implementing a "one window" approval process to speed up major projects. Doubling the Indigenous Loan Guarantee to $10 billion, unlocking access to capital for First Nations, Inuit and Métis.Providing more funding for regional development agencies.Removing any mobility restrictions for federally regulated professions. Carney said removing barriers to the free movement of workers, goods and services would increase the size of Canada's economy by $250 billion — equivalent to more than $6,000 for every Canadian.He said he is proud the federal government moved on a number of projects today, such as the Cedar LNG and LNG Canada in B.C. and Port of Churchill in northern Manitoba. "It's high time to build," Carney said. Carney told reporters he would maintain a carbon emissions cap, but that legislation isn't enough to reduce emissions, which is why, he said, he is "focused on action."  "One of the projects, I firmly believe this, of national significance is major investments in carbon capture and storage," he said. "We have the opportunity not just to get emissions down but very importantly to create an entirely new industry that will serve Canadians well but will create exports and jobs and opportunities for many decades."The Conservative Party later alleged Carney was lying about his support of Canada's oil and gas industry."If Carney was sincere, he would immediately commit to the full repeal of the Liberals' C-69, the 'No More Pipelines' Act, C-48, the West Coast Tanker Ban, and the production cap," the party said in a statement. "Instead he doubled down on capping Canadian energy production."Carney's announcement about a national development strategy is also reminiscent of Conservative campaign promises.Just yesterday, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said in Jonquière, Que., that he plans to create "shovel-ready zones" with pre-approved construction permits for major resource or energy projects if elected.In 2019, Conservative Andrew Scheer, leader of the Official Opposition at the time, pledged that if elected, his government would build a single coast-to-coast energy corridor to transport natural resources.Most premiers in agreement: FordIn a scrum with reporters following the meeting, Ontario Premier Doug Ford said most premiers agreed about eliminating trade barriers, with he and the federal government intending to clear all exemptions."Nova Scotia is clearing all exemptions. As we move across the country, eventually everyone is going to hop on," he said. "They'll have no choice but to hop on board. Not forced, but there will be so much pressure within their territory or their province."Ford repeated that all options remain on the table, including potentially increasing an energy tax on the U.S. despite Alberta Premier Danielle Smith's opposition to that approach. WATCH | Carney presents national strategy:"Ontario will decide that. No other jurisdiction," he said. "I don't worry about her oil and she doesn't have to worry about my energy."Smith and Saskatchewan's Scott Moe and B.C.'s David Eby attended virtually, as did Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Andrew Furey who is in Japan for a trade mission.Ford reiterated that he would work with anyone as long as it's in Ontario's best interest. New Brunswick Premier Susan Holt voiced support for Carney, saying in French that she is "very happy" to have him as prime minister while Canada is under tariff threats. "From what I've seen of Mr. Carney and the conversations we have had, his passion for Canada shines through, his intelligence shines through," she said. She said she has yet to meet with Poilievre and doesn't have a comparison point. WATCH | How trade works in this border city: Legault wants 'global negotiation'  Shortly after arriving for the meeting, Quebec Premier François Legault told reporters that he wants the next prime minister to ask Trump for a "global" negotiation of a trade agreement rather than one that is piecemeal."Right now, Mr. Trump doesn't respect the agreement between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, especially on steel and aluminum. So it's important we renegotiate all the agreement," he said.He said premiers and the prime minister need to be careful about counter-tariffs and "eventual" counter-tariffs to maximize the negative impact on U.S. businesses but minimize the impact on Canadian ones. The Quebec premier said his province would be "open" to pipeline projects, due to Trump's threats, but there needs to be social acceptability.Yukon Premier Ranj Pillai acknowledged that, with increased focus on the North and the Arctic, it's important to hear the plans of all political parties for the region, especially in light of the rhetoric south of the border.Pillai said he wants to make sure the prime minister is aware that it is a "special moment in time for us" and that his visit to Iqaluit, the first domestic trip of his leadership of Canada, was "important and set a tone.""Other people are focusing on the North and we sure need to do the same," Pillai said. "In the first week, personally, I'm very impressed with what I've seen."Nunavut Premier P.J. Akeeagok agreed, saying it was great to see Carney underline "how important the North is and how much incredible of an opportunity we have to provide the country with an opportunity to diversify."Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew emphasized the need for a "solid plan for Canada's economy" because the country is "fighting a trade war on two fronts.""Trump tariffs certainly attract so much attention, but in Manitoba and in Western Canada, the tariffs from the People's Republic of China on canola and pork are having a major impact already," Kinew said.With files from CBC's Olivia Stefanovich, Lisa Mayor, Meagan Fitzpatrick, Kate McKenna, Raffy Boudjikanian]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A protester in Turkey reading Rousseau&apos;s The Social Contract in front of police water cannons</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1jgva1w/a_protester_in_turkey_reading_rousseaus_the/</link><author>/u/Background-Oil-9203</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 23:54:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Are Anti-Musk Attacks Affecting Tesla, Elon?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_eCgA1gN5M</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/X_eCgA1gN5M?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 23:15:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Bloomberg's Max Chafkin shares his thoughts on what to make of Tesla's stock down almost 50% from its December peak and various anti-Musk attacks happening & whether or not Elon Musk is able to turn things around.

But I can tell you if we did, we're very well-equipped to handle it," he said.He also rejected reports that his adviser Elon Musk would be briefed on how the United States would fight a hypothetical war with China - a rare suggestion that his far-reaching role in the administration will face limits."Elon has businesses in China," he said. "And he would be susceptible, perhaps, to that."The president confirmed he would be speaking to China's president Xi Jinping about tariffs. Mr Trump also said there was flexibility on his controversial economic measure.It comes as Mr Trump expressed enthusiasm for possibly becoming a member of the Commonwealth.Sharing an article on his Truth Social network about plans to allegedly make the USA the next associate member, the President wrote: "I Love King Charles. Sounds good to me!"'Our allies are calling constantly'The plane's design remains a closely-held secret, but would likely include stealth, advanced sensors, and cutting-edge engines.The initial contract to proceed with production on the jets is worth an estimated $20bn (£15.5bn).Enable CookiesAllow Cookies OnceMr Trump said the jets will be built over several years and "it's something nobody has ever seen before"."Our allies are calling constantly," Trump said, adding foreign sales could be an option. "They want to buy them also."After saying the US would "tone down" the new jets by 10% for any sales to allies, Trump said: "[It] probably makes sense, because someday, maybe they're not our allies."Critics have questioned the cost and the necessity of the programme as the Pentagon is still struggling to fully produce its current most advanced jet, the F-35, which is expected to cost taxpayers more than $1.7tr (£1.01tr) over its lifespan.'I'll pay out of my own pocket'Meanwhile, Mr Trump said he will pay NASA astronauts  overtime pay after their trip to the International Space Station lasted nine months longer than planned.A reporter at the news conference said the pair are not entitled to overtime pay, prompting Mr Trump to say: "If I have to, I'll pay it out of my own pocket."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump transfers student loan program out of Education Dept. | Reuters</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JdicmLIEeo</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/8JdicmLIEeo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 21:12:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[US President Donald Trump said his administration will transfer responsibility for the federal government's student loans, nutrition and special needs programs from the Department of Education to other departments

(This is) significant enough to help continue to bring the prices down for right now” she said.The US is also in talks with other countries for additional imports.The move is part of a five-point plan Rollins unveiled in early March to combat the crisis which has driven egg prices up by 15.2% in January 2025—the largest monthly increase since June 2015. Over the past five years, egg prices have surged by 230%, according to Labor Department data.Rollins emphasized the importance of biosecurity measures to control the avian flu outbreak, which has devastated poultry populations for nearly two years.“The most proven way to solve for that is through biosecurity measures and what that means is locking down your barns,” she said. “Since we began doing that ... we've seen a significant decline in the bird flu.”The US is also working to repopulate egg-laying hens, a process Trump administration claims slowed by regulations from previous administrations."When our chicken populations are repopulated and we've got a full egg laying industry going again ... we then shift back to our internal egglayers and moving those eggs out onto the shelf," Rollins added.It was earlier announced that Türkiye will send 15,000 tons of eggs by June 2025 as a key short-term solution.Long-term measures include a $1 billion investment to stabilize the market and prevent future outbreaks. “This is a pretty big, massive plan,” Rollins said on February, expressing optimism about its impact.]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
