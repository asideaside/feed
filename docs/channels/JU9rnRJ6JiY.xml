We are very grateful for all the support received from fans all over the world and that we were able to spread the charm of hololive production to more than 14,000 visitors in 6 major cities within 6 months. We always appreciate the love from hololive production fans around the world and strive to give as many people as possible the chance to experience hololive production 3D concerts. In this report, we would like to share with you the excitement and milestones we have achieved together with you and the talents!About hololive STAGE World Tour ’24 -Soar!-As hololive STAGE, we hope to bring the best 3D performances to every world stage for everyone to enjoy. The first hololive STAGE concert, a world tour, was conceptualized with the theme of “Soar!”. With “Soar!” as the concert title, we wanted to fly higher and further together. In the key visual illustrated by OMOCAT, each talent has a wing symbol on their back to further emphasize this message. The first world tour featured 7 of our talents: AZKi and Tsunomaki Watame from hololive, Moona Hoshinova and Kobo Kanaeru from hololive Indonesia, as well as Takanashi Kiara, Ninomae Ina’nis and Hakos Baelz from hololive English. Together, they delivered spectacular musical performances in multiple languages that were loved by international audiences. A unique experience for each show in different cities was created by varying each set list and also creating special performances tailored to the local audience. From solo, duet, to group performances in both the default and Our Bright Parade costumes and also the retro theatre-style stage, hololive STAGE World Tour ’24 -Soar!- provided an unforgettable experience for every hololive fan, regardless of their location. To further hype up our first world tour, the fan favorite “Shiny Smily Story” was also arranged in an EDM style. Starting from the Jakarta venue, “Shiny Smily Story” Soar Ver. has become one of the highlights of the concert, positioned as the last song. To enhance and immortalize the experience, we also released hololive STAGE World Tour ’24 -Soar!- merchandise in the form of T-shirts, penlights, and towels. These items were available for purchase through both hololive production’s online store and at each venue’s merchandise booth. In addition, unique merchandise was available at select venues.
