I’ve got five things I want to do here:This post will be long, with some detours and extra thoughts. But I think that’s the best way to get tricky stuff. A story keeps it interesting and helps you remember the important bits. So, this won’t just be words – it’ll be a journey with logic and aha moments.Explain the basics simplyWe’ll look at the building blocks and steps to figure out if a point’s in a triangle. Lots of people write about this, but I think they miss stuff or make it too quick. I’ll do it my way.I’ll stick to the ideas that help solve this one question.Even something small like this takes more understanding than you’d guess. I want to show that.This is from a book I’m writing. I’m testing if it works for readers.Just as the world is made up of atoms and molecules, at the heart of any 3D program lies the triangle. So, let’s begin our story with the triangle and explore why it’s so crucial for 3D graphics. Let’s turn to the definition from Wikipedia:A triangle is a figure consisting of three line segments, each of whose endpoints are connected. This forms a polygon with three sides and three angles.Sounds terribly boring, doesn’t it? But don’t let that fool you – triangles are amazing. They’re behind your favorite 3D editor, video game, or big movie. Everything 3D on your screen? It’s all triangles doing the heavy lifting, turned into pixels in the end (they call that rasterization). Here’s a heads-up: I might bend some geometry rules a bit. Serious math folks could get mad, but I think you can explain tricky stuff in a way that clicks faster than slogging through years of math classes.So, let’s begin! We have the concept of a triangle: three points connected by three lines. Now, let’s break our molecule down into atoms.Digression 1: Why the Triangle?Time for a quick side trip (and there’ll be more, trust me) about why triangles are the go-to for 3D graphics, instead of something like a point or a circle.Triangles can fake any shapeEven a circle! Pile up enough triangles, and you can make it look close enough to trick the eye.So, why not pick something else? Your screen’s just a bunch of pixels – tiny dots. Smooth shapes like circles don’t fit that world easily. You’ve got to fake them with something chunkier, like triangles.Triangles are old friendsThe properties of triangles have been well understood since the days of Pythagoras, making them a reliable and mathematically solid choice.Triangles make it easy to figure out things like light, shadows, and textures in graphics, way better than trickier shapes.All the modern graphics gear is built to handle triangles fast and smooth.Side trip done – let’s get back to the atoms of our triangle, the points!A point marks a spot in space, plain and simple. It doesn’t have width, length, or thickness. But when we put it on paper, we make it a big dot anyway.What can we do with points? In other words, what operations can we perform on points?You can technically add their parts x, y, z. But does it make sense? Not at all. So, adding points doesn’t really do much.Can we subtract points? Yes, and it gives us something new – a . You just take one point’s coordinates and subtract the other’s. Say you’ve got two points in 3D,  and . Subtract them, and you get a vector .Let’s take a quick look at vectors before we get back to . A might seem like a at first – same numbers – but it’s not. It’s about and . Take two points,  and . Subtract  – , and you get a vector, , that shows the way from  to . And if you measure that vector’s size – its magnitude, , you’ll get the distance between  and .If we draw the vector  on a coordinate system, starting at  and going to , we get a line that shows its direction.Now, take point  and add vector  to it. What do you get? Point ! So,  it’s like the vector moves you from  to .If we take point  and subtract vector  from it, we end up back at point . So,  That’s how you can shift a point using a vector.Now, if you flip the vector’s sign – make it negative – you get the same , just pointing the other way. For example,   turns into .So, what’s possible with ? We can them or them. No big shock – the result is always another vector. But how do we picture it?To show the between two , think of it as adding one to the opposite of the other: . It’s still a parallelogram, just with  flipped around.Start with vector  at the origin. Then take , reverse it to make , and put it at the end of . Draw the parallelogram using  and  as sides. The diagonal from the origin? That’s .A Simple Trick to Remember Operations Between Points and VectorsWant an easy way to handle points and vectors? Here’s a little trick: add a , w, to the usual x, y, z.For a , it’s (x, y, z, 1) – the w is 1.For a , it’s (x, y, z, 0) – the w is 0.With this, we can sort out all the operations between them. Let’s see how it works.That fourth coordinate, w, has another big role – we’ll get to it later. For now, let’s just keep it in mind as something neat. Going forward, we’ll drop it to keep things simple.Digression 2: Point vs Vector classesIn programming, we usually split things into two classes: and . But honestly, a lot of coders find that annoying. They’d rather treat a point like a – just another starting from the . That way, they can do all the math stuff, like adding or subtracting, without worrying about what’s a point and what’s a vector.Say you’ve got two points,  and , and you want the angle between them from the . You could write it like this:Point O(0, 0, 0);
Vector vA = A-O;
Vector vB = B-O;
double angle = std::acos(dot(vA, vB) / (length(vA) * length(vB)));
But if you just treat  and  as radius vectors, it gets shorter:double angle = std::acos(dot(A, B) / (length(A) * length(B)));
The second way is quicker to write, sure. Still, for us, making sense of things matters more than saving a line or two. Keeping and separate keeps it clear what’s what.Calculating Distance / Vector LengthLet’s tackle the distance between two points again. Take  and . Picture a straight line between them. To measure it, think of the x-difference, , and the y-difference, . Square those, add them up – – and then take the square root. That’s your distance: This works in 3D too. For points  and , the distance is just: . Same idea, one more step.Got a  with a length ? Divide its components  by . That gives you a unit , or a . We call this dividing step . These have a of 1 and point the way, making things simpler to figure out. Why are they big in computer graphics?Normals show how light lands on surfaces – think brightness, shadows, or shiny reflections.They help tricks like Phong shading make lighting look smooth and nice.Reflection and RefractionFor stuff like water or glass, normals handle reflections and bending light.In games, they tell objects how to hit or bounce off each other.Normals fake extra detail in things like normal mapping, no extra shapes needed.So, you’ve picked up the essentials – how to work with points and vectors, and even how to measure a vector’s length. Just a few more steps, and you’ll have this whole thing figured out!What else can we do with vectors? There’s this thing called the  or – that’s super useful in geometry, physics, and graphics. Surprise: it gives you a (or ), not a . It’s all about checking how much two vectors go the same way. Can we figure that out? Sure, here’s how:Put simply, the dot product here just looks at the  of  – how much of it .When one vector’s y-part is zero, like , it’s easy to see, like we showed before. But what if the y-part isn’t zero? Let’s try two vectors:  and . Let’s do something fun: rotate  around so it sits on the x-axis. That zeroes out its y-part, leaving it pointing flat across. We’ll swing  the same way too. Then, we just see how much  lines up with this new .And  gets the same twist, ending up as:.Now it’s simple: we just find the dot product between a vector flat on the x-axis and one with both x and y parts.Since rotating doesn’t change the dot product, we calculate:So in the end, there is another way to calculate the dot product using the formula: The cosine function appears here because it naturally describes alignment:Picture this: you’re in a dark room, holding a laser pointer. You aim it at a wall, but not straight on – it’s at an angle. The light doesn’t just hit one spot; it stretches across the wall. How long that streak is depends on your aim:When the laser is  at the wall, the projection is maximal, meaning the  is . For unit vectors, the result is 1. When the laser is , the projection , resulting in a . When the laser is to the wall, there is no projection at all, and the  equals . When the laser is pointing in the direction from the wall, the  is . For unit vectors, the result is -1.Just a heads-up: we’re deep in dot product territory. It’s a big topic, full of details, but super important. If you get the dot product – really get it, with all its twists – it’ll make everything later so much easier. It’s the heart of all the cool stuff coming up.What if we need to determine the angle  between two vectors? We can  using the inverse cosine function:Think of arccos as a way to convert a similarity measurement into an actual angle:This is extremely useful in applications like robotics, physics, 3D graphics, and AI, where finding angles between directions is crucial. The function always returns an angle in the range from  to  (or from  to  radians).Now, let’s introduce the final operation you’ll frequently encounter: the , also known as the . Intuitively, this operation is simpler than the  because the result is something you can visualize – a new .At this stage, I’d like to ask for your patience – don’t worry about where this formula comes from. Just memorize it for now, and later you’ll “teleport” back to it from another section.The cross product can also be expressed as:where  is the  perpendicular to the plane containing  and .The direction of  (and ) is determined by the : curl the fingers of your right hand from  to , and your thumb will point in the direction of .Finally, let’s conclude our detour and return to our original task – determining whether a point is inside a triangle! At this stage, we have covered the basic geometric primitives: points, vectors, and operations on them. Now, with this knowledge, let’s finally solve our problem.Is the point contained within the triangle? Cross Product MethodThis method’s easy and makes sense, and it pulls together all the math we’ve gone over. For each edge of the triangle, we compute a cross product between the edge vector and the vector from the test point  to one of the triangle’s vertices. That gives us three vectors that act like normals.Each normal  represents the orientation of the test point relative to a specific edge of the triangle.If  is inside the triangle, all three cross-product normals should point in the same direction. If all three dot products have the same sign, then the point lies inside the triangle. Otherwise, at least one normal vector points in the opposite direction, indicating that  is outside.It is very important to note that this method works correctly only when the point lies in the . This condition is often neglected in computer graphics since most algorithms do not require it. However, if you are working with engineering software and require precise calculations, it makes sense to add a check to ensure that the point lies in the triangle’s plane. In practice, such a check is usually performed earlier in the pipeline, calling the point-in-triangle test, as part of collision detection, intersection tests, or geometric preprocessing.bool isPointInsideTriangle(glm::dvec3 P, glm::dvec3 A, glm::dvec3 B, glm::dvec3 C, double epsilon) {
    // Compute the normal of triangle ABC and check if it's degenerate
    glm::dvec3 N = glm::cross(B - A, C - A);

    // Compute normals for sub-triangles PBC, PCA, PAB
    glm::dvec3 U = glm::cross(B - P, C - P);  // Normal of PBC
    glm::dvec3 V = glm::cross(C - P, A - P);  // Normal of PCA
    glm::dvec3 W = glm::cross(A - P, B - P);  // Normal of PAB

    // Compute scalar products of sub-triangle normals with the triangle normal
    double dot_u = glm::dot(U, N);
    double dot_v = glm::dot(V, N);
    double dot_w = glm::dot(W, N);

    return sameSigns(dot_u, dot_v, dot_w, epsilon);
}

The  method can run into trouble because of small math mistakes. These pop up when numbers get rounded off during multiplying and subtracting. It’s a problem when vectors are almost the same, especially in really thin (or as we call it – ) triangles, and the answer might be off. Also, the final check – seeing if all normals point the same way – can mess up. If those normals shift and look almost at right angles because of these tiny errors, the test might call an inside point outside. helps by giving some extra space for those mistakes, making the checks better. You need to pick the right epsilon, though, or you might count outside points as inside or miss points that are barely inside.Digression 3. Vector Operations: Functions vs. OperatorsWhen handling vectors, libraries like offer functions like and for scalar and vector products, instead of using signs like * or %. This has some good points. For one, and make it clear what math you’re doing, so the code’s easier to understand. Take  – it shows right away it’s a dot product. But  could mean different things, like multiplying by a number, doing it part by part, or even a dot product, depending on the setup. Same with  – it’s obvious it’s a cross product, while % isn’t something everyone knows and might remind people of division leftovers instead.Another thing: functions like and make your code safer and easier to keep up. Signs like * can do lots of jobs – like multiplying by a number or working with matrices – which can mix things up if you’re not sure what’s meant or if the pieces don’t fit right. But and are built just for vectors, so you’re less likely to mess up. For instance, if you try with the wrong mix – like a and a plain  – a good library will catch it before the code even runs. With *, it might quietly do something you didn’t want.Digression 4. Degenerate trianglestriangles are bad – they don’t help anyone. They hold no real info. Either all their points sit on top of each other, or they line up straight. So, their is pretty much . To spot these, we can figure out the triangle’s area using the  of its edge vectors and see if it’s tiny – below a small limit, . This way, we catch triangles that barely exist, whether because the points overlap or fall in a line, and kick them out before moving on. Here’s some code that checks if a triangle’s degenerate by looking at its area:bool isDegenerate(glm::dvec3 A, glm::dvec3 B, glm::dvec3 C, double area_epsilon) {
    // Compute vectors along two edges of the triangle
    glm::dvec3 AB = B - A;
    glm::dvec3 AC = C - A;

    // Compute the cross product to get the normal vector
    glm::dvec3 N = glm::cross(AB, AC);

    // Compute the area as half the magnitude of the normal
    double area = 0.5 * glm::length(N);

    // Return true if the area is below the threshold, indicating degeneracy
    return area < area_epsilon;
}
So, we need to put this check at the beginning of our isPointInsideTriangle method. Next, we would like to address the problem mentioned at the beginning – we want to check if the point lies in the plane of the triangle.A plane in 3D is like a big, flat sheet that goes on forever, set by a point and a normal vector. And guess what? The  – or , as we call it now – saves the day again, tying all this geometry into a simple idea. Imagine a plane with a  and a , which stands straight up from the plane, at right angles to anything on it.struct Plane {
    glm::dvec3 N;  // A,B,C
    double D;
};
To check if a point  lies on the plane, we evaluate:If the result 0 (within a small tolerance), the point lies exactly on the plane.If , the point is above the plane.If , the point is below the plane.bool isOnPlane(Plane plane, glm::dvec3 P, double epsilon) {
    return std::abs(glm::dot(plane.N, P) + plane.D) <= epsilon;
}
To make a with a and a  vector, start with the plane equation. Plug in your point  to figure out the constant .Plane createPlane(glm::dvec3 P, glm::dvec3 N) {
    N = glm::normalize(N);
    double D = -glm::dot(N, P);
    return { N, D };
}
If you need to see if the point’s on the triangle’s plane, add this step after ruling out a bad triangle. Think we’re done? Not even close. The method we went over is simple and pretty quick, but it’s got some weak spots, like we said before. Next, we’ll check out other ways to do this, and for that, we’ll need to dig even more into geometry basics.Digression 6. Can you compute a cross product in 2D?No, you cannot compute a  in a strictly two-dimensional space in the same way as in 3D – because the result is not a vector in 2D. However, if we extend the 2D vectors into 3D by assuming their -coordinates are zero and use the standard 3D cross product formula:and set the -coordinates to zero, treating 2D vectors as lying in the -plane of 3D space, we obtain:Since the only nonzero component is the -coordinate, we can define the 2D cross product as the scalar:This scalar represents the signed area of the parallelogram formed by  and .Thus, the signed area can be used to determine whether a 2D point is inside a 2D triangle. To do this, you need to compute the signed area of the triangle ABC and all the “sub-triangles” ABP, BCP, and CAP. If all the areas have the same sign, then the point lies inside the triangle.bool isPointInsideTriangle(glm::dvec2 P, glm::dvec2 A, glm::dvec2 B, glm::dvec2 C, double area_epsilon) {
    // Compute the area of the triangle
    double triangleArea = area(A, B, C);

    // Check if the triangle is degenerate (area too small)
    if (std::abs(triangleArea) < area_epsilon)
        return false;

    // Compute areas of sub-triangles formed by point P
    double area1 = area(A, B, P);
    double area2 = area(B, C, P);
    double area3 = area(C, A, P);

    // Check if all sub-triangle areas have the same orientation (same sign)
    return sameSigns(triangleArea, area1, area2, area3, area_epsilon);
}
To get a triangle’s area using the 2D cross product, just take the absolute value of that cross product and cut it in half.double area(glm::dvec2 A, glm::dvec2 B, glm::dvec2 C) {
    glm::dvec2 vec1 = B - A;
    glm::dvec2 vec2 = C - A;
    double crossProductValue = vec1.x * vec2.y - vec1.y * vec2.x;
    return 0.5 * crossProductValue;
}
Now, let’s finally return to where we started – the Triangle!Phew! We took a detour, but now let’s return to the triangle. Consider a triangle defined by three vertices: , , and . Some useful properties we can compute are:Picture a different triangle with the same barycentric coordinates  for a point. They still tell us how it sits relative to the corners.How do barycentric coordinates solve our first question? It’s pretty easy. If all the weights u, v, w are between 0 and 1, the point is inside the triangle.Digression 7. Lines and SegmentsFor example: take . The weights come out as  and . That means  is pulling harder here.Start with the segment vector , and the vector from  to , which is . Think of  as sitting somewhere along the line:Now, use the dot product with  on both sides:Then, the other weight is just .Barycentric Coordinates: TriangleLet’s figure out if point  is inside triangle , but this time, let’s keep it really simple. Imagine you’re at , and you’ve got paths to  and . Any point inside the triangle is like a mix of steps toward  and .So how do we find  and ? Think of it as measuring how much  leans toward each path. We can “ask”  how much it matches  and  using dot products – like checking shadows:This gives us two clues:To find the coordinates, we solve the two equations above, and the results are:Then, the last piece is:Keep in mind that this method, like the previous one, assumes that the point lies in the .bool isPointInTriangle(glm::dvec3 P, glm::dvec3 A, glm::dvec3 B, glm::dvec3 C, double epsilon) {
    // Define vectors along edges
    glm::dvec3 AB = B - A;
    glm::dvec3 AC = C - A;
    glm::dvec3 AP = P - A;

    // Compute the normal of triangle ABC
    glm::dvec3 N = glm::cross(AB, AC);

    // Compute dot products needed for barycentric coordinates
    double dotABAB = glm::dot(AB, AB);
    double dotABAC = glm::dot(AB, AC);
    double dotACAC = glm::dot(AC, AC);
    double dotAPAB = glm::dot(AP, AB);
    double dotAPAC = glm::dot(AP, AC);

    // Compute denominator
    double denom = dotABAB * dotACAC - dotABAC * dotABAC;
    if (std::abs(denom) < epsilon) 
        return false; // Denominator too small, unstable result
    
    double invDenom = 1.0 / denom;

    // Compute barycentric coordinates (v, w, u)
    double v = (dotACAC * dotAPAB - dotABAC * dotAPAC) * invDenom;
    double w = (dotABAB * dotAPAC - dotABAC * dotAPAB) * invDenom;
    double u = 1.0 - v - w;

    // Check if the point lies inside the triangle within epsilon tolerance
    return (u >= -epsilon) && (v >= -epsilon) && (w >= -epsilon);
}

If you still think this is the end, it’s not! There is another method that is often used in more precise engineering applications. Projection onto a 2D PlaneEvery triangle in 3D lies flat on a plane, so we can shrink this problem down to 2D. Pick a plane – like the xy-plane, xz-plane, or yz-plane – and project everything onto it.Here’s the trick: first, find the plane the triangle’s on. Check if the point’s near it, with a little room for error. If it is, we just need to see if it’s inside the triangle. Since the triangle’s flat in 3D, it’s a 2D question at heart. To keep it easy, we drop one coordinate from the triangle and the point, them down.Note that checks have been added for  and whether the point lies on the .Also, note that in the code below, the from the isDegenerate method could have been reused, but I left it as is for better clarity.bool isPointInsideTriangle(glm::dvec3 P, glm::dvec3 A, glm::dvec3 B, glm::dvec3 C, double epsilon, double area_epsilon) {
    // Check if the triangle is degenerate
    if (isDegenerate(A, B, C, area_epsilon))
        return false;  // Triangle is degenerate

    // Compute the normal of triangle ABC
    glm::dvec3 N = glm::cross(B - A, C - A);

    // Create the plane from point A and normal, then check if P lies in it
    Plane plane = createPlane(A, N);
    if (!isOnPlane(plane, P, epsilon))
        return false;  // Point is not in the plane

    // Determine the dominant axis for projection
    glm::dvec3 absN = glm::abs(N);
    uint8_t dominantAxis = (absN.x > absN.y && absN.x > absN.z) ? 0 :
                       (absN.y > absN.z ? 1 : 2);

    // Lambda to drop the dominant axis
    auto drop = [dominantAxis](glm::dvec3 v) -> glm::dvec2 {
        return (dominantAxis == 0) ? glm::dvec2(v.y, v.z) :  // Drop X
               (dominantAxis == 1) ? glm::dvec2(v.x, v.z) :  // Drop Y
                                     glm::dvec2(v.x, v.y);   // Drop Z
    };

    // Project the point onto the plane. Note that we checked it with epsilon before, now we want to lie exactly on the plane 
    glm::dvec3 projectedP = projectPointOntoPlane(P, plane);

    // Test in 2D
    return isPointInsideTriangle(drop(projectedP), drop(A), drop(B), drop(C), epsilon);
}

We drop the coordinate with the largest component in the normal, since it contributes the least to variations across the triangle. The normal shows how the triangle is tilted in space, and its points to the axis the plane is nearly perpendicular to. Removing that axis gives us a reliable 2D projection for checking point inclusion.The final thing is to project our point  onto the plane, which follows the rule . We do this by sliding  along the plane’s normal  until it hits the plane at . That’s written as:, where  is how far we need to move.Since  is on the plane, it fits the equation:.Thus,  is the projection of  onto the plane.glm::dvec3 projectPointOntoPlane(glm::dvec3 P, Plane plane) {
    double lambda = (glm::dot(plane.N, P) + plane.D) / glm::dot(plane.N, plane.N);
    return P - lambda * plane.N;
}
Usually, this is where you’d expect a conclusion for the article – something about which method is better, which one’s worse, and why we picked this over that other one. But since this is just a from a book, there’s no big wrap-up here. Instead, it rolls right into a more advanced, high-level problem down the road. So, for this post, the conclusion isn’t about crowning a winner among the methods. It’s more about how cool it is to break a problem down into tiny bricks and figure it out step by step with some neat math tools. What I really wanted to show here is how you can tackle the same task – checking if a point’s inside a triangle – in totally different ways. We’ve got the , the  trick, and that  move, each with its own strengths and trade-offs. They all get the job done, but they’re like different paths up the same hill. And by now, you’ve probably felt how much you need to know to code this stuff – , , nuances, and a touch of with to keep it all steady. It’s a lot of concepts to juggle! In the end, I hope messing around with this brought you some fun and maybe a little buzz from seeing how math and code can dance together.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>💃 Chopin’s most AMORAL music? 😈 #chopin #waltz #piano</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiZ-DpqWfHE</link><author>Ben Laude</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/EiZ-DpqWfHE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 19:36:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnSFlVqRyNfIJDsmpkcY57w">Ben Laude</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[🔥 The Chopin Podcast Season 2 is here! 🔥

Slashdot reader AndrewZX calls the blog post "an excellent deep dive" into the machine's history and capabilities "and the classic Venix UNIX that it ran." The blogger still owns a working 1984 DEC Professional 380, "a tank of a machine, a reasonably powerful workstation, and the most practical PDP-adjacent thing you can actually slap on a (large) desk." 

But more importantly, "It runs PRO/VENIX, the only official DEC Unix option for the Pros."
 In that specific market it was almost certainly the earliest such licensed Unix (in 1983) and primarily competed against XENIX, Microsoft's dominant "small Unix," which first emerged for XT-class systems as SCO XENIX in 1984. You'd wonder how rogue processes could be prevented from stomping on each other in such systems when neither the Intel 8086/8088 nor the IBM PC nor the PC/XT had a memory management unit, and the answer was not to try and just hope for the best. It was for this reason that IBM's own Unix variant PC/IX, developed by Interactive Systems Corporation under contract as their intended AT&T killer, was multitasking but single-user since in such an architecture there could be no meaningful security guarantees... 
One of Venix's interesting little idiosyncrasies, seen in all three Pro versions, was the SUPER> prompt when you've logged on as root (there is also a MAINT> prompt when you're single-user... 

Although Bill Gates had been their biggest nemesis early on, most of the little Unices that flourished in the 1980s and early 90s met their collective demise at the hands of another man: Linus Torvalds. The proliferation of free Unix alternatives like Linux on commodity PC hardware caused the bottom to fall out of the commercial Unix market. 

The blogger even found a 1989 log for the computer's one and only guest login session — which seems to consist entirely of someone named tom trying to exit vi. 


But the most touching part of the article comes when the author discovers a file named /thankyou that they're certain didn't come with the original Venix. It's an ASCII drawing of a smiling face, under the words "THANK YOU FOR RESCUING ME". 

"It's among the last files created on the system before it came into my possession..." 

It's all a fun look back to a time when advances in semiconductor density meant microcomputers could do nearly as much as the more expensive minicomputers (while taking up less space) — leaving corporations pondering the new world that was coming:
As far back as 1974, an internal skunkworks unit had presented management with two small systems prototypes described as a PDP-8 in a VT50 terminal and a portable PDP-11 chassis. 
Engineers were intrigued but sales staff felt these smaller versions would cut into their traditional product lines, and [DEC president Ken] Olsen duly cancelled the project, famously observing no one would want a computer in their home.

Part of that is through fuzzing and dog­food­ing, some can be through sta­tis­tics, but the ﬁrst lines of de­fense will con­tinue to be unit and in­te­gra­tion test­ing. This past week par­tic­u­larly, I’ve been read­ing up on how other big lint­ing pro­grams ap­proach this prob­lem.1. Test Features, Not CodeI of­ten ask my­self: am I spend­ing more time think­ing or talk­ing about the thing, or am I spend­ing more time do­ing the thing? I’ve per­son­ally seen how pro­jects fall into de­cline be­cause their lead­ers are more in­ter­ested in plan­ning than do­ing.In the con­text of soft­ware test­ing, this mantra is trans­formed intotest fea­tures, not code.” To my eye, good code is ﬂex­i­ble and self-ex­plana­tory. Tests that hook deeply into ap­pli­ca­tion or li­brary in­ter­nals make code less ﬂex­i­ble and harder to read.I es­pe­cially like Alex Kladov’s heuris­tic for this: the neural net­work test.Can you re-use the test suite if your en­tire soft­ware is re­placed with an opaque neural net­work?” - Alex KladovIt’s not a ques­tion of whether a neural net­work would pass the test suite, only whether the test suite could work for it. If the an­swer is no, the tests are likely test­ing code, not fea­tures.The speed at which you can build and run tests (unit, sta­tic, in­te­gra­tion, etc.) is a force-mul­ti­plier for every­thing else. You can val­i­date ideas sooner, run  faster, and get con­trib­u­tors on-boarded in less time.Our goal to be fast at run­time dove­tails quite nicely into this, so it’s some­thing Harper al­ready does quite well. Moving for­ward, we need to make sure that we don’t rely on any kind of  in our tests, since that con­tin­ues to be the slow­est part of most Harper in­te­gra­tions.We can sim­plify pro­grams like Harper down into a sin­gle func­tion which con­sumes text and re­turns a list of ob­served prob­lems.(text: ) <Lint>{
    
}
Most test­ing we are in­ter­ested can be done with as­ser­tion func­tions that de­clare what qual­i­ties the out­put should have with a spe­ciﬁc in­put.For ex­am­ple, we have a func­tion called as­sert_­sug­ges­tion_re­sult, which runs a gram­mat­i­cally in­cor­rect string through Harper, ap­plies the ﬁrst re­sult­ing sug­ges­tion and checks whether the edited string matches a given value.() {
    (
        ,
        ThenThan::(),
        ,
    );
}
It’s also vi­tal that these as­ser­tions show good, read­able er­ror mes­sages when they fail. Each time I’ve im­proved their logs, I get un­prompted pos­i­tive feed­back from con­trib­u­tors.Moving for­ward, I’d like to cre­ate a more di­verse ar­ray as­ser­tions like this, as well as bet­ter-doc­u­ment their use. A lot of the cur­rent back-and-forth for rule con­tri­bu­tions is re­lated this.I hope some­one does. Good test suites are some­thing I’m con­tin­u­ing to learn how to build. I un­der­stand that a lot of what I’ve said here does­n’t ap­ply to other kinds of ap­pli­ca­tions or code­bases. If there’s nu­ance I’m not cov­er­ing here, let me know!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>KEDA, prometheus, scale from 0</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1jhfpvn/keda_prometheus_scale_from_0/</link><author>/u/Scheftza</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>k8s</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 18:54:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I have a very simple spring-boot application, now what I want to achieve is to scale the app from 0 based on a prometheus metric, the problem is that when I try to trigger scaling up with an http request it doesn't work as there's no pod running.

Russia and its proxies are accused by western officials of "staging dozens of attacks and other incidents across Europe since the invasion of Ukraine three years ago," reports the Associated Press. 

That includes cyberattacks and committing acts of sabotage/vandalism/arson, as well as spreading propaganda and even plotting killings, according to the article. ("Western intelligence agencies uncovered what they said was a Russian plot to kill the head of a major German arms manufacturer that is a supplier of weapons to Ukraine...") The news agency documented 59 incidents "in which European governments, prosecutors, intelligence services or other Western officials blamed Russia, groups linked to Russia or its ally Belarus."

[Western officials] allege the disruption campaign is an extension of Russian President Vladimir Putin's war, intended to sow division in European societies and undermine support for Ukraine... The incidents range from stuffing car tailpipes with expanding foam in Germany to a plot to plant explosives on cargo planes. They include setting fire to stores and a museum, hacking that targeted politicians and critical infrastructure, and spying by a ring convicted in the U.K. Richard Moore, the head of Britain's foreign intelligence service, called it a "staggeringly reckless campaign" in November... 

The cases are varied, and the largest concentrations are in countries that are major supporters of Ukraine... In about a quarter of the cases, prosecutors have brought charges or courts have convicted people of carrying out the sabotage. But in many more, no specific culprit has been publicly identified or brought to justice. 
Despite that, "more and more governments are publicly attributing attacks to Russia," the article points out. 
This week a nonprofit, bipartisan think tank on global policy released a report which "found that Russian attacks in Europe quadrupled from 2022 to 2023 and then tripled again from 2023 to 2024," reports the New York Times.
Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland noted in a social media post on Monday that Lithuanian officials had confirmed his assessment that Russia was responsible for a series of fires in shopping centers in Warsaw and Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital...

Recently I've been doing more work with Go and wanted to host my own modules. I'm not super fond of hosting my code on GitHub because I feel like I don't totally own anything that I don't have root on. So I decided to look into how Go fetches modules and what it takes to host my own.There are a few reasons why I like to self-host: Like I mentioned, if I don't have root on the box that is hosting my code then I don't feel in control. Touching every part of the stack gives you insights into how everything fits together. I really enjoy building software, so learning new things is always interesting to me.While I've used Go, I haven't had to think too much about how it actually works under-the-hood. Luckily, Go's documentation is very clear about how it fetches modules, if a little dense. Here's the gist of it:: The  path in  can provide a VCS specifier (to point to a repo), or no specifier (to use HTTP).: A  tag pulled from the module path (taken as an HTTP URL) points to a VCS or  can be used to point to a URL that implements the GOPROXY protocol for the module.: If using a VCS, then it is dependent on the VCS. Using  and the GOPROXY protocol only requires a few static files to specify versions and module bundles.Once I realized that all Go needs is a directory structure containing , , , and  files to fetch modules, I realized it was easily doable. This is when the idea of  came to be.A simple static file host is enough to serve Go modules reliably.CONR (ode nly, o epo) is a tool I wrote originally in TypeScript/zx and translated into Go with ChatGPT. The goal: point CONR at your existing Git repositories, and it automatically does the heavy lifting to package them for self-hosting. Here's a quick rundown:: Make sure your Go modules have valid semantic version tags (e.g. ).: go install code.nicktrevino.com/conr/cmd/conr@latest: conr --mod /path/to/myrepo --outDir ./dist --showSkipsYou can pass  multiple times if you have multiple modules you'd like to package up.When done, the  folder will contain a structure that Go's module downloader loves:dist/<module/path>/@v/list
dist/<module/path>/@v/v1.0.0.mod
dist/<module/path>/@v/v1.0.0.zip
dist/<module/path>/@v/v1.0.0.info
dist/<module/path>/@latest
These files map directly to the requests Go makes when you  a module. From here all that is left is to throw them on the internet at  with the proper  tag. For example, I host my modules at  on this subdomain and have my <meta name="go-import" content="code.nicktrevino.com mod https://code.nicktrevino.com/go.mod"> tag on both CONR's home page, and the root of the subdomain. I placed it on both pages because Go will follow and double-check the meta tags.Hosting the Generated FilesSo on to hosting the files. I've mentioned Caddy before, but it has to be one of my favorite pieces of software recently. Caddy makes static file hosting a breeze with its  directive. While I use Cloudflare Tunnel to expose my services, Caddy makes a lot of sense for self-hosting due to automatic TLS handling (if configured). Here's an example  that will serve everything from  which you can dump the output into:{
  admin off
  debug on
}

:443 {
  log

  handle /go.mod/* {
    header Content-Type text/plain
  }

  file_server browse {
    root /www
  }
}
Note that I purposefully add the  parameter to , but you can certainly leave it off if it makes you more comfortable.Once Caddy was running, I tested with fetching another module and  fetched from my domain successfully!Finishing this project felt liberating. I discovered that Go modules are fundamentally a simple set of files served at predictable URLs, and was able to easily follow the Go documentation to build . In the end, combining that with a minimal Caddy setup gave me everything I needed for a robust, self-hosted module repository that I trust.Hopefully I've inspired others to take the self-hosting journey for their own Go modules!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>French actor Depardieu faces trial over alleged sexual assaults | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxGej58pIBc</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/fxGej58pIBc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 17:59:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[French actor Gerard Depardieu faces trial over alleged sexual assaults of two women on a film set, a case placing one of the world's best known movie stars at the heart of France's broader reckoning over sexual violence.

The California-based company has publicly reported that it is in financial distress and stated in securities filings that there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Due to the trove of sensitive consumer data 23andMe has amassed, Attorney General Bonta reminds Californians of their right to direct the deletion of their genetic data under the Genetic Information Privacy Act (GIPA) and California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA). Californians who want to invoke these rights can do so by going to 23andMe's website. “California has robust privacy laws that allow consumers to take control and request that a company delete their genetic data,” said Attorney General Bonta. “Given 23andMe’s reported financial distress, I remind Californians to consider invoking their rights and directing 23andMe to delete their data and destroy any samples of genetic material held by the company.” To Delete Genetic Data from 23andMe:Consumers can delete their account and personal information by taking the following steps:Log into your 23andMe account on their website. Go to the “Settings” section of your profile.Scroll to a section labeled “23andMe Data” at the bottom of the page. Click “View” next to “23andMe Data”Download your data: If you want a copy of your genetic data for personal storage, choose the option to download it to your device before proceeding.Scroll to the “Delete Data” section. Click “Permanently Delete Data.” Confirm your request: You’ll receive an email from 23andMe; follow the link in the email to confirm your deletion request.To Destroy Your 23andMe Test Sample:If you previously opted to have your saliva sample and DNA stored by 23andMe, but want to change that preference, you can do so from your account settings page, under “Preferences.”To Revoke Permission for Your Genetic Data to be Used for Research:If you previously consented to 23andMe and third-party researchers to use your genetic data and sample for research, you may withdraw consent from the account settings page, under “Research and Product Consents.”Under GIPA, California consumers can delete their account and genetic data and have their biological sample destroyed. In addition, GIPA permits California consumers to revoke consent that they provided a genetic testing company to collect, use, and disclose genetic data and to store biological samples after the initial testing has been completed. The CCPA also vests California consumers with the right to delete personal information, which includes genetic data, from businesses that collect personal information from the consumer.   To learn more about the CCPA, please visit here.  ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Map Features in OpenStreetMap with Computer Vision</title><link>https://blog.mozilla.ai/map-features-in-openstreetmap-with-computer-vision/</link><author>Brysonbw</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 17:42:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[At Mozilla.ai, we believe that there are a lot of opportunities where artificial intelligence (AI) can empower communities driven by open collaboration. These opportunities need to be designed carefully, though, as many members of these communities (and people in general) are increasingly worried about the amount of  flooding the internet.With this idea in mind we developed and released the  Blueprint. If you love maps and are interested in training your own computer vision model, you’ll enjoy diving into this Blueprint.Data is one of the most important components of any AI application, and  has a vibrant community that collaborates to maintain and extend the most complete open map database available. If you haven’t heard of it,  is an open, editable map of the world created by a community of mappers who contribute and maintain data about roads, trails, cafés, railway stations, and more.Combined with other sources, like satellite imagery, this database offers infinite possibilities to train different AI models.As a long-time user and contributor to  , I wanted to build an end-to-end application where a model is first trained with this data and then used to contribute back.The idea is to use AI to speed up the slower parts of the mapping process (roaming around the map, drawing polygons) while keeping a human in the loop for the critical parts (verifying that the generated data is correct).Large Language Models (LLM) and, more recently, Visual Language Models (VLM) are sucking all the oxygen out of the AI room, but there are a lot of interesting applications that don’t (need to) use this type of models.Many of the  you can find in OpenStreetMap are represented with a polygon ('Area'). It turns out that finding and drawing these polygons is a very time consuming task for a human, but Computer Vision models can be easily trained for the task (when provided with enough data).We chose to split the work of finding and drawing map features into 2 computer vision tasks using state-of-the-art non-LLM models:  with , by Ultralytics, which identifies where relevant features exist in an image.with , by Meta, which refines the detected features by outlining their exact shape.These models are lightweight, fast, and local-friendly – it’s refreshing to work with models that don’t demand a high-end GPU just to function. As an example, the combined weights of YOLOv11 and SAM2 take much less disk space (<250MB) than any of the smallest Visual Language Models available, like (4.5GB).By combining these models, we can automate much of the mapping process while keeping humans in control for final verification.The OpenStreetMap AI Helper BlueprintThe Blueprint can be divided into 3 stages:Stage 1: Create an Object Detection dataset from OpenStreetMapThe first stage involves fetching data from OpenStreetMap, combining it with satellite images, and transforming it into a format suitable for training.For fetching OpenStreetMap data, we use:Once all the polygons have been downloaded, you can choose a . We use this zoom level to first identify all the tiles that contain a polygon and then download them using the  from .The polygons in latitude and longitude coordinates are transformed to a bounding box in pixel coordinates relative to each tile and then saved in the .Stage 2 - Finetune an Object Detection modelOnce the dataset is uploaded in the right format, finetuning a  (or any other model supported by Ultralytics) is quite easy. Stage 3 - Contributing to OpenStreetMapOnce you have a finetuned Object Detection model, you can use it to run inference across multiple tiles. We also provide a hosted demo where you can try our example swimming pool detector: .The inference requires a couple of human interactions. First, you need to first pick a point of interest in the map:After a point is selected, a bounding box is computed around it based on the argument.All the existing elements of interest are downloaded from , and all the tiles are downloaded from  and joined to create a stacked image.The stacked image is divided into overlapping tiles. For each tile, we run the Object Detection model (YOLOv11). If an object of interest is detected (e.g. a swimming pool), we pass the bounding box to the Segmentation model () to obtain a segmentation mask.All the predicted polygons are checked against the existing ones, downloaded from OpenStreetMap, in order to avoid duplicates. All those identified as are displayed one by one for manual verification and filtering.The ones you chose to keep will be then uploaded to OpenStreetMap in a single OpenStreetMap is a powerful example of open collaboration to create a rich, community-driven map of the world. The OpenStreatMap AI Helper Blueprint shows that, with the right approach, AI can enhance human contributions while keeping human verification at the core. In the fully manual process it takes about 1 min to map 2-3 swimming pools, whereas using the blueprint, even without an optimized UX, I can map about 10-15 in the same time (~5x more).It also highlights the value of high-quality data from projects like OpenStreetMap, which enables to easily train models like YOLOv11 to perform object detection – proving that you shouldn’t always throw an LLM at the problem.We’d love for you to try the OpenStreetMap AI Helper Blueprint and experiment with training a model on a different map feature. If you’re interested, feel free to contribute to the repo to help improve it, or fork it to extend it even further!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Surprisingly, Some Dyson Spheres and Ringworlds Can Be Stable</title><link>https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/03/22/0414254/surprisingly-some-dyson-spheres-and-ringworlds-can-be-stable?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 17:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Slashdot reader Required Snark shared this article from Phys.org:


In the realm of science fiction, [sun-energy capturing] Dyson spheres and ringworlds have been staples for decades. But it is well known that the simplest designs are unstable against gravitational forces and would thus be torn apart. Now a scientist from Scotland, UK has shown that certain configurations of these objects near a two-mass system can be stable against such fractures... 


[A] rigid ring around a star or planet, as in Larry Niven's "Ringworld" series of novels, is also unstable, as it would drift under any slight gravitational differences and collide with the star. So [engineering science professor Colin] McInnes considered a restricted three-body problem where two equal masses orbit each other circularly with a uniform ring of infinitesimal mass rotating in their orbital plane. The ring could enclose both masses, just one or none... McInnes also investigated a shell-restricted three-body problem with the shell also of infinitesimal mass, again with the shell enclosing two masses, one or none. 

For the restricted ring, McInnes found that there are seven equilibrium points in the orbital plane of the dual masses, on which, if the ring's center were placed, it would stay and not experience stresses, akin to the three stable Lagrange points where a small mass can reside permanently for the two-body problem... McInnes restricted this research to a planar ring (in the plane of the circularly orbiting masses) but says it can be shown that a vertical ring, normal to the plane, can also generate equilibria... 

These results can aid the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, McInnes said, "If we can understand when such structures can be stable, then this could potentially help direct future SETI surveys." An important technosignature would be one bright star orbiting in tandem with an object showing a strong infrared excess. Shells around a sun-exoplanet pair or an exoplanet-exoplanet pair could also be possible. A nested set of Dyson spheres is also a feasible geometry.

“deep” vs “shallow” modules (in the author’s terms a module is any kind of
abstraction, separated into the user-facing interface and the underlying
implementation).The author argues that “the best modules are those that provide powerful
functionality yet have simple interfaces”. The argument is  about absolute
size, but rather the ratio of utility afforded by the abstraction compared to
the size of the abstraction itself, in other words, a cost/benefit tradeoff.In our case, the main mechanism for composable abstractions in Go is the
 type, so let’s examine the concept through this lens.To me, maybe the best example of a deep interface is .It couldn’t possibly get  smaller than that, right? It’s simple enough
that you won’t ever need to look it up again. Searching the Go standard library, one will find
numerous implementations
including reading from files, from network connections, compressors, ciphers
and more.This abstraction is both easy to understand and use; the docstring tells you
everything you, as a user, need to know. The underlying implementation can be
buffered, may allow reading from streams or remote locations like an S3
bucket. But crucially, consumers of this API don’t need to worry about 
reading happens — implementation can be deep and non-trivial,
but a user doesn’t have to care. Furthermore, it allows for very little
ambiguity when reasoning about what the code does.All these properties are  important for core functionality that’s
used frequently.On the other hand, an example of a shallow interface I’ve used recently is from
the redis-go client.I’ve trimmed it down for the purposes of this post, but you can see it 
here
in its entirety. It contains 45 methods  uses 19 other interfaces as
extensions for a total of ~200 methods.While the functionality provided by Redis is much larger than just ‘reading’,
each of these methods has a much simpler implementation; they do exactly one
thing, and they’re small enough you could possibly replicate them just by their
name and arguments. The ratio of the functionality provided to the size of
the abstraction is very different than before.This also shifts the responsibility of doing the right thing towards the
user, as they have to understand the nuances between individual methods.
In a code review, this makes it harder to reason about what happens at a
glance.So, is this another post criticizing other dev practices? Not really. As
always, things exist on a spectrum and these previous examples show the two
extremes.As a developer, it can often feel more natural to write shallower interfaces.
Similar ‘shallow’ examples (that are not strictly interfaces) are the
aws-sdk-go’s session Options or
Viper’s
public API. Why?It makes methods smaller and easier to testIt maps more closely to the mental map of the system itselfIt takes less time to think up-front about how the user will consume itUsually, it only affords a single implementation, maybe two, so it’s easier
to imagine how it will be usedIn contrast,  offers additional advantages:Can be easily retrofitted to other use casesRequires no state checks to use properlyInterfaces like this tend to remain stable over time, while a shallower version would often grow to accommodate more and more featuresIt allows for natural composability into other abstractions, like a  or a type ReadCloser interface {
	Reader
	Closer
}
This not a  comparison, as you will rarely write such core functionality
as the Reader from scratch, and well, Cmdable is not an abstraction but rather
a driver covering the entirety of Redis operations.But still, does that client API  five different methods for saving and
shutting down? Does a user of the client need to deal with both running
commands and getting meta-information around the DB connection and runtime
metrics at the same time? Is each of the datatypes different enough to have
their own interface? And do I as a reviewer, need to know beforehand whether
the code needs to ,  or ?So, next time you design or review an abstraction, take a closer look.
How “deep” is your API?
In what ways could you mold it into something simpler that hides complexity
from the user and reduces cognitive load?And that’s all for today! If you have any comments, remarks or ideas, feel free
to reach out to me on Bluesky.What are your favorite interfaces? Any specific one that you think touches the
Platonic ideal? Any that disgusts you beyond imagination and makes you wanna
quit, move to the countryside and grow tomatoes? Let me know!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Week in Review: Google buys Wiz</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/22/week-in-review-google-buys-wiz/</link><author>Karyne Levy</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 17:05:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome back to Week in Review!

Humanity is facing serious disputes over our most important resource. What impact is our lifestyle having on our planet's water cycles?

Along six rivers on four continents, the documentary explores the question of why this vital resource, water, is becoming increasingly scarce - and who’s responsible. 70 per cent of fresh water is used in agriculture. And a large proportion of this goes into the production of animal feed. Our excessive meat consumption is partly to blame for the fact that mighty rivers such as the Spanish Ebro or the Colorado in the USA and Mexico are drying up. Factory farming businesses are worth billions to major agricultural companies, but this overuse of water often goes hand in hand with its pollution. Europe has outsourced its dirtiest industries to countries such as India. Around 20 per cent of global water pollution is caused by the textile industry. The film provides rare insights into Indian factories and life in the places where contaminants are discharged.

But it’s not all bad news. In the film, we also meet people who’ve come up with solutions. In France, dams are dismantled to revitalize rivers; in an Egyptian oasis the inhabitants experiment with hydroponics; and in India, an individual known as the "water man” uses a millennia-old technique to coax rivers from deserts that dried up decades ago.

While releasing 63,000 unredacted pages about the 1963 assassination of President Kennedy, the U.S. government erroneously "made public the Social Security numbers and other sensitive personal information of potentially hundreds of former congressional staffers and other people," reports USA Today. ("It is virtually impossible to tell the scope of the breach because the National Archives put them online without a way to search them by keyword, some JFK files experts and victims of the information release told USA TODAY...") 

Mark Zaid, a national security lawyer who represented current and former spies and other officials in cases against the government, told USA Today that he "saw a few names I know and I informed them of the breach... Hundreds were doxxed but of that number I don't know how many are still living."

Zaid, who has fought for decades for the JFK records to be made public, said many of the thousands of investigative documents had been made public long ago with everything declassified and unredacted except for the personal information. Releasing that information now, he told USA TODAY, poses significant threats to those whose information is now public, including dates and places of birth, but especially their Social Security numbers. "The purpose of the release was to inform the public about the JFK assassination, not to help permit identity theft of those who actually investigated the events of that day," Zaid said.

The Associated Press reported Thursday afternoon that government officials "said they are still screening the records to identify all the Social Security numbers that were released."
One of the newly unredacted documents... discloses the Social Security numbers of more than two dozen people seeking security clearances in the 1990s to review JFK-related documents for the Assassination Records Review Board.

This release offers Plug and Play fixes, audio fixes, memory management fixes, registry healing, improvements to accessories and system tools including Notepad, Paint, RAPPS, the Input Method Editor, and shell improvements.We chose to release this version of ReactOS in honor of Eric Kohl’s first commit to the ReactOS code base, which dates back to 1999.
Eric Kohl is the oldest active contributor of the project, and this is his 26th ReactOS anniversary!
He has participated in the project as a developer since its beginnings.This release is a culmination of the work of numerous contributors since 0.4.14 was branched in 2020.
This has been the largest release to date.
There are nearly 8 times more commits going into this release than in 0.4.14.
We are proud of the progress we have made, and are eager to continue with this growth.
Let’s dive in and see what’s new.Victor Perevertkin (Extravert-ir) has accomplished major rewrites to the Plug and Play Manager in the ReactOS kernel.
With these changes, ReactOS now has the ability to run more third party drivers and to boot from USB devices.
This also allows ReactOS to boot on chipsets with EHCI, OHCI, and UHCI controllers.
This work is a stepping stone to ReactOS being truly compatible with vendor drivers for the Windows operating system.Johannes Anderwald (janderwald) solved an issue where the USB driver would enter an infinite loop when a USB device would not enter the ready state.
Fixing this infinite loop allowed ReactOS to boot on more hardware.Thanks to the work of Oleg Dubinskiy, 0.4.15 features many audio improvements.
Oleg added support for more audio formats, looped playback of wave files, higher sample rates, and multiple output channels.
In addition, Victor Perevertkin imported the open source AC’97 driver from the Windows Driver Kit (WDK).
This enables sound out of the box in VirtualBox when the virtual machine is configured to use the ICH AC’97 Audio Controller and various motherboards from 2004 and earlier.Memory Manager and Cache ControllerSection Objects have been refactored by Jérôme Gardou (zefklop) for better compatibility with Windows.
This fixes a long-standing bug preventing executables from starting in remote locations, such as network shares or virtual machine shared folders.Because of improvements in the memory manager and cache controller, we can now import the open source Microsoft FAT filesystem driver from the Windows Driver Kit (WDK).
This FAT filesystem driver is a huge improvement from the old one, which was slower and less stable.
Additionally, external drives with FAT filesystem can now be properly ejected thanks to this new driver.Registry Healing and CachingFundamental mechanisms of the system registry have been implemented courtesy of George Bișoc (GeoB99).
These mechanisms include registry healing, flushing, and caching.
Registry healing and flushing are both designed to improve system stability when faced with an unexpected power outage or a crash.
Healing applies appropriate fixes to a corrupted registry and flushing periodically writes registry changes to the disk, ensuring registry changes persist even if the system is not cleanly shut down.
Caching improves performance when accessing it.George Bișoc also improved the Security Subsystem (Se) of the kernel.
Prior to George’s work, kernel access checks always passed, allowing anyone to access any system object.
Now, kernel access checks are fully functional and prevent unauthorized access to system objects.
As a result, the Windows kernel now works with the vast majority of modules from ReactOS.Katayama Hirofumi MZ (katahiromz) has been hard at work making quality of life improvements, performance enhancements, and new features in system accessories such as the text tool in Paint and the “Now Printing” dialog in Notepad.
Katayama Hirofumi MZ has also improved the Input Method Editor (or IME), which is a component that types characters not originally present on the connected input devices by using a sequence of characters.
His work improved CJK support and allows for the installation of custom IMEs for different locales. For example, Japanese ReactOS can now utilize MZ-IME Japanese input.
Whindmar Saksit (whindsaks) made several bugfixes to improve the stability of RAPPS and Hermès Bélusca-Maïto (HBelusca) implemented a minimal view mode for RAPPS for uninstalling programs.Japanese input with MZ-IME and CJK fontIn 0.4.15 the graphical shell was improved by several contributors.
Carl Bialorucki (cbialorucki) added support for large taskbar icons.
Mark Jansen (learn-more) added native ZIP archive support.
Doug Lyons (DougLyons) made several fixes to address an issue where incorrect icons were displayed in programs such as Microsoft Office 2000, Microsoft Visual Basic 6, and Hoyle Cards.
Katayama Hirofumi MZ added support for the “Internet Browser” icon on the desktop.
In addition, Whindmar Saksit made several bugfixes to improve the stability of Shell32, a critical component of the ReactOS shell.In this release, we also decided to set the default visual style and wallpaper to Mizu.
More visual styles and wallpapers are available in RAPPS.ReactOS is a community of people focused around the Windows ecosystem and free open source software.
It includes various projects to research and document Windows internals, use Windows software in a free enviornment, and make life easier for the broader Windows developer community.0.4.15 was branched 6 months ago.

His positive view of the Kremlin’s leader was only matched by Carlson’s description of Witkoff as “the most effective American diplomat in a generation.”Talking about his two meetings with Putin on Feb. 11 and March 13, Witkoff said “I liked him. I think he was honest with me.”Carlson said that assessment was shared by “all the presidents in the world” including Joe Biden: “They may not agree with what Russia is doing, but they say: ‘You know, Putin is an open person,’” Carlson said.Witkoff, in response to criticism of the bilateral meetings with Russia, said that as the “president’s emissary” he had been tasked with attempts to restore [US-Russian] relations and to start productive discussion on “how to end this conflict.”It's a complicated situation, this war, and all the components that led to it. You know, it's never just one person who's right.He said that Putin had criticized the Biden administration’s refusal to enter in dialogue. “President Putin said to me at our first meeting: ‘How do we resolve a conflict with the head of a major nuclear power if we don’t establish trust and good relations with each other? … I haven’t spoken to Joe Biden in three and a half years’,” Witkoff said.He summed up his meetings with Putin as the first steps in what will become “a good, healthy conversation” between the two countries saying: “President Putin, to his credit, has sent every signal to President Trump that this is the path he wants to take.”In addition to describing Putin as “not a bad person,” Witkoff said: “It’s a complicated situation, this war, and all the components that led to it. You know, it’s never just one person who’s right.”Witkoff added that after the July 13 assassination attempt against Trump, Putin went to church and prayed for him: “… not because he could be the president of the United States, but because they had a friendship, and he prayed for his friend.” He added telling Trump of this, “He [Trump] was clearly touched.”If there is a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia the consensus is that Ukraine cannot be a member of NATO.In speaking about the situation on the battlefield Witkoff repeated the contentions that Ukrainian troops have been surrounded in Russia’s Kursk region – despite the claim being contradicted by the Ukrainian authorities, independent experts, and even US intelligence assessments.He added that Putin told him Kursk wasn’t the only instance where his troops had surrounded and isolated Kyiv’s forces.“President Putin told me that: ‘… the Ukrainians have people trapped there [Kursk]’... he then asked: ‘What should I do in this or that area where we have people surrounded and they don’t want to surrender? Should I kill them? How can I make them surrender? I’m happy not to kill everyone. I’m happy to make people wave a white flag if I can make them.’”Asked about Ukraine’s aspiration to join NATO (and Moscow’s declaration this would be an unacceptable red line) or failing that to at least be offered “Article 5 protection,” Witkoff said:“I think [Ukraine’s president] Zelensky and his right-hand man Yermak, have pretty much accepted that Ukraine will not become a member of NATO. There has been a lot of talk about whether they could have Article 5 protection… from the US or from European countries without being a member of NATO? I think that’s open to debate… but… If there is a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia the consensus is that Ukraine cannot be a member of NATO.”If the world recognizes these [five regions] as Russian territories, will this end [the war] and will Zelensky survive politically if he recognizes this?Asked by Carlson about European fears that if Russia “wins” in Ukraine Putin would “want to march on Europe,” Witkoff simply replied “100% no.” He then went further saying he didn’t believe Moscow wanted to “absorb” the whole of Ukraine:“… The Russians have what they want: They got back these five regions. They have Crimea. They got what they wanted. So what else do they want?” He then went on to say that the main ongoing problem to resolving the war is the issue of [the occupied] territories.In another echo of the Kremlin propaganda line Witkoff said that the “Russian speaking residents” of these regions [Crimea, Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson] had overwhelmingly indicated they wanted to be part of the Russian Federation in referendums – a process that most of the world thinks were not only illegal but were held under occupation, subject to coercion (sometimes at gunpoint) and falsification in the absence of independent observers.He then mentioned, what he called “the elephant in the room” - Ukrainian constitutional issues that prevented the ceding of territories despite being under de facto Russian control and then asked the question: “If the world recognizes these [five regions] as Russian territories, will this end [the war] and will Zelensky survive politically if he recognizes this?”Needless to say, international media and analysts expressed concern (in the case of Ukrainian media outrage) that Witkoff’s commentary seemed to spout almost verbatim Putin’s avowed red lines for peace, was filled with half-truths and reiterated many of “Moscow’s lies.”In particular, his assertion that the remaining obstacle to peace was the future of (and Kyiv’s agreement to give up) the occupied territories. He seemed to suggest that these should remain as part of Russia, including by implication, those parts of the contested regions that remain under Ukrainian control. In general, comments on Ukrainian social media expressed fears for the country’s future as the US continues to “hand over the keys to the kingdom” before negotiations proper have even started.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Facebook to stop targeting ads at UK woman after legal fight</title><link>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1en1yjv4dpo</link><author>dijksterhuis</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 16:22:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) legislation controls how personal information is used by organisations.Ms O'Carroll's lawsuit argued that Facebook's targeted advertising system was covered by the UK's definition of direct marketing, giving individuals the right to object.Meta said that adverts on its platform could only be targeted to groups of a minimum size of 100 people, rather than individuals, so did not count as direct marketing.

There is hope that Russia will take action if China participates in the mission. This was reported by Welt, citing EU diplomatic circles, reports . China is apparently considering participating in a possible peacekeeping force in Ukraine. Chinese diplomats in Brussels have been probing the question of whether such a step would be conceivable and possibly even desirable from Europe's point of view Diplomatic circles in Brussels said: "The inclusion of China in the "coalition of the willing" could potentially strengthen Russia's agreement to the presence of peacekeeping forces in Ukraine." In any case, the issue is "sensitive."French President Emmanuel Macron has announced another summit of supporters of Ukraine next Thursday. "Next Thursday we will hold a summit of the coalition of the willing," Macron said Thursday evening after the EU summit in Brussels. "My goal on Thursday is, first of all, a renewed, clear and possibly somewhat more concrete commitment to support Ukraine in the short term."Macron added that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will also attend the summit in Paris. Both Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer are ready to deploy peacekeepers to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire between Moscow and Kyiv - an idea that, according to Welt, Russia has so far categorically rejected. Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Georgiy Tykhyi reported that several countries have officially stated their readiness to send military contingents to Ukraine, and a corresponding list has already been formed.On March 20, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that there is currently a different vision regarding the military contingent for Ukraine, because there are countries that are ready to provide it in the event of a repeated aggression by the Russian Federation, there are those who agree to be located on the border, and there are those who want only at sea or in central large cities. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a common vision.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Rare Volcanic Lightning Strikes at Volcán de Fuego in Guatemala 🌋⚡ #VolcanoPhotography #Shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBr8_JgsljQ</link><author>BBC Earth Science</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/aBr8_JgsljQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 16:00:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdsOTr6SmDrxuWE7sJFrkhQ">BBC Earth Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[#VolcanicLightning #NatureWonders]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Majority of AI Researchers Say Tech Industry Is Pouring Billions Into a Dead End</title><link>https://slashdot.org/story/25/03/22/0341222/majority-of-ai-researchers-say-tech-industry-is-pouring-billions-into-a-dead-end?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 15:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Founded in 1979, the Association for the Advancement of AI is an international scientific society. Recently 25 of its AI researchers surveyed 475 respondents in the AAAI community about "the trajectory of AI research" — and their results were surprising. 

 Futurism calls the results "a resounding rebuff to the tech industry's long-preferred method of achieving AI gains" — namely, adding more hardware:


You can only throw so much money at a problem. This, more or less, is the line being taken by AI researchers in a recent survey. Asked whether "scaling up" current AI approaches could lead to achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI), or a general purpose AI that matches or surpasses human cognition, an overwhelming 76 percent of respondents said it was "unlikely" or "very unlikely" to succeed... 

"The vast investments in scaling, unaccompanied by any comparable efforts to understand what was going on, always seemed to me to be misplaced," Stuart Russel, a computer scientist at UC Berkeley who helped organize the report, told New Scientist. "I think that, about a year ago, it started to become obvious to everyone that the benefits of scaling in the conventional sense had plateaued...." In November last year, reports indicated that OpenAI researchers discovered that the upcoming version of its GPT large language model displayed significantly less improvement, and in some cases, no improvements at all than previous versions did over their predecessors. In December, Google CEO Sundar Pichai went on the record as saying that easy AI gains were "over" — but confidently asserted that there was no reason the industry couldn't "just keep scaling up."

 Cheaper, more efficient approaches are being explored. OpenAI has used a method known as test-time compute with its latest models, in which the AI spends more time to "think" before selecting the most promising solution. That achieved a performance boost that would've otherwise taken mountains of scaling to replicate, researchers claimed. But this approach is "unlikely to be a silver bullet," Arvind Narayanan, a computer scientist at Princeton University, told New Scientist.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Levittown: The battle against deepfakes</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdvubBk_wqg</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/gdvubBk_wqg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 15:30:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When dozens of young women discover manipulated photos of themselves on a porn site, they fight back - joining a global battle against deepfakes.

It’s pretty hard to combine code from two different programming languages in the same process–unless one of them is C. The same could theoretically be true for Rust, but in practice there are a number of obstacles that make that harder than it needs to be. Building out silky smooth language interop should be a core goal of helping Rust to target foundational applications. I think the right way to do this is not by extending rustc with knowledge of other programming languages but rather by building on Rust’s core premise of being an extensible language. By investing in building out an  we can allow crate authors to create a plethora of ergonomic, efficient bridges between Rust and other languages.We’ll know we’ve succeeded when…When it comes to interop…It is easy to create a Rust crate that can be invoked from other languages and across multiple environments (desktop, Android, iOS, etc). Rust tooling covers the full story from writing the code to publishing your library.It is easy to carve out parts of an existing codebase and replace them with Rust. It is  easy to integrate Rust into C/C++ codebases.When it comes to extensibility…Rust is host to wide variety of extensions ranging from custom lints and diagnostics (“clippy as a regular library”) to integration and interop (ORMs, languages) to static analysis and automated reasoning^[math].In my head, I divide language interop into two core use cases. The first is what I call  (LCD), where people would like to write one piece of code and then use it in a wide variety of environments. This might mean authoring a core SDK that can be invoked from many languages but it also covers writing a codebase that can be used from both Kotlin (Android) and Swift (iOS) or having a single piece of code usable for everything from servers to embedded systems. It might also be creating WebAssembly components for use in browsers or on edge providers.What distinguishes the LCD use-case is two things. First, it is primarily unidirectional—calls mostly go  the other language  Rust. Second, you don’t have to handle all of Rust. You really want to expose an API that is “simple enough” that it can be expressed reasonably idiomatically from many other languages. Examples of libraries supporting this use case today are uniffi and diplomat. This problem is not new, it’s the same basic use case that WebAssembly components are targeting as well as old school things like COM and CORBA (in my view, though, each of those solutions is a bit too narrow for what we need).When you dig in, the requirements for LCD get a bit more complicated. You want to start with simple types, yes, but quickly get people asking for the ability to make the generated wrapper from a given language more idiomatic. And you want to focus on calls  Rust, but you also need to support callbacks. In fact, to really integrate with other systems, you need generic facilities for things like logs, metrics, and I/O that can be mapped in different ways. For example, in a mobile environment, you don’t necessarily want to use tokio to do an outgoing networking request. It is better to use the system libraries since they have special cases to account for the quirks of radio-based communication.To really crack the LCD problem, you also have to solve a few other problems too:It needs to be easy to package up Rust code and upload it into the appropriate package managers for other languages. Think of a tool like maturin, which lets you bundle up Rust binaries as Python packages.For some use cases,  is a very important constraint. Optimizing for size right now is hard to start. What’s worse, your binary has to include code from the standard library, since we can’t expect to find it on the device—and even if we could, we couldn’t be sure it was ABI compatible with the one you built your code with.Needed: the “serde” of language interopObviously, there’s enough here to keep us going for a long time. I think the place to start is building out something akin to the “serde” of language interop: the serde package itself just defines the core trait for serialization and a derive. All of the format-specific details are factored out into other crates defined by a variety of people.I’d like to see a universal set of conventions for defining the “generic API” that your Rust code follows and then a tool that extracts these conventions and hands them off to a backend to do the actual language specific work. It’s not essential, but I think this core dispatching tool should live in the rust-lang org. All the language-specific details, on the other hand, would live in crates.io as crates that can be created by anyone.Lang interop: the “deep interop” use caseThe second use case is what I call the  problem. For this use case, people want to be able to go deep in a particular language. Often this is because their Rust program needs to invoke APIs implemented in that other language, but it can also be that they want to stub out some part of that other program and replace it with Rust. One common example that requires deep interop is embedded developers looking to invoke gnarly C/C++ header files supplied by vendors. Deep interop also arises when you have an older codebase, such as the Rust for Linux project attempting to integrate Rust into their kernel or companies looking to integrate Rust into their existing codebases, most commonly C++ or Java.Some of the existing deep interop crates focus specifically on the use case of invoking APIs from the other language (e.g., bindgen and duchess) but most wind up supporting bidirectional interaction (e.g., pyo3, [npapi-rs][], and neon). One interesting example is cxx, which supports bidirectional Rust-C++ interop, but does so in a rather opinionated way, encouraging you to make use of a subset of C++’s features that can be readily mapped (in this way, it’s a bit of a hybrid of LCD and deep interop).Interop with all languages is important. C and C++ are just more so.I want to see smooth interop with all languages, but C and C++ are particularly important. This is because they have historically been the language of choice for foundational applications, and hence there is a lot of code that we need to integrate with. Integration with C today in Rust is, in my view, “ok” – most of what you need is there, but it’s not as nicely integrated into the compiler or as accessible as it should be. Integration with C++ is a huge problem. I’m happy to see the Foundation’s Rust-C++ Interoperability Initiative as well a projects like Google’s crubit and of course the venerable cxx.The traditional way to enable seamless interop with another language is to “bake it in” i.e., Kotlin has very smooth support for invoking Java code and Swift/Zig can natively build C and C++. I would prefer for Rust to take a different path, one I call . The idea is to enable interop via, effectively, supercharged procedural macros that can integrate with the compiler to supply type information, generate shims and glue code, and generally manage the details of making Rust “play nicely” with another language.In some sense, this is the same thing we do today. All the crates I mentioned above leverage procedural macros and custom derives to do their job. But procedural macrods today are the “simplest thing that could possibly work”: tokens in, tokens out. Considering how simplistic they are, they’ve gotten us remarkably, but they also have distinct limitations. Error messages generated by the compiler are not expressed in terms of the macro input but rather the Rust code that gets generated, which can be really confusing; macros are not able to access type information or communicate information between macro invocations; macros cannot generate code on demand, as it is needed, which means that we spend time compiling code we might not need but also that we cannot integrate with monomorphization. And so forth.I think we should integrate procedural macros more deeply into the compiler. I’d like macros that can inspect types, that can generate code in response to monomorphization, that can influence diagnostics and lints, and maybe even customize things like method dispatch rules. That will allow all people to author crates that provide awesome interop with all those languages, but it will also help people write crates for all kinds of other things. To get a sense for what I’m talking about, check out F#’s type providers and what they can do.The challenge here will be figuring out how to keep the stabilization surface area as small as possible. Whenever possible I would look for ways to have macros communicate by generating ordinary Rust code, perhaps with some small tweaks. Imagine macros that generate things like a “virtual function”, that has an ordinary Rust signature but where the body for a particular instance is constructed by a callback into the procedural macro during monomorphization. And what format should that body take? Ideally, it’d just be Rust code, so as to avoid introducing any new surface area.Not needed: the Rust Evangelism Task ForceSo, it turns out I’m a big fan of Rust. And, I ain’t gonna lie, when I see a prominent project pick some other language, at least in a scenario where Rust would’ve done equally well, it makes me sad. And yet I also know that if  project were written in Rust, that would be . I mean, who would we steal good ideas from?I really like the idea of focusing our attention on making Rust work well with other languages, not on convincing people Rust is better . The easier it is to add Rust to a project, the more people will try it – and if Rust is truly a better fit for them, they’ll use it more and more.This post pitched out a north star wherea single Rust library can be easily used across many languages and environments;Rust code can easily call and be called by functions in other languages;this is all implemented atop a rich procedural macro mechanism that lets plugins inspect type information, generate code on demand, and so forth.How do we get there? I think there’s some concrete next steps:Build out, adopt, or extend an easy system for producing “least common denominator” components that can be embedded in many contexts.Look for ways to extend proc macro capabilities and explore what it would take to invoke them from other phases of the compiler besides just the very beginning.An aside: I also think we should extend rustc to support compiling proc macros to web-assembly and use that by default. That would allow for strong sandboxing and deterministic execution and also easier caching to support faster build times.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Denis Alexander - Fallacies in Proving God Exists?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_HoOa4DZfk</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/S_HoOa4DZfk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 15:00:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Like us on Facebook for daily videos, updates, announcements, and much more: https://shorturl.at/tak4l

Today I want to talk about the internals of PyTorch.This talk is for those of you who have used PyTorch, and thought to yourself, "It would be great if I could contribute to PyTorch," but were scared by PyTorch's behemoth of a C++ codebase.  I'm not going to lie: the PyTorch codebase can be a bit overwhelming at times. The purpose of this talk is to put a map in your hands: to tell you about the basic conceptual structure of a "tensor library that supports automatic differentiation", and give you some tools and tricks for finding your way around the codebase.  I'm going to assume that you've written some PyTorch before, but haven't necessarily delved deeper into how a machine learning library is written.The talk is in two parts: in the first part, I'm going to first introduce you to the conceptual universe of a tensor library.  I'll start by talking about the tensor data type you know and love, and give a more detailed discussion about what exactly this data type provides, which will lead us to a better understanding of how it is actually implemented under the hood.  If you're an advanced user of PyTorch, you'll be familiar with most of this material.  We'll also talk about the trinity of "extension points", layout, device and dtype, which guide how we think about extensions to the tensor class.  In the live talk at PyTorch NYC, I skipped the slides about autograd, but I'll talk a little bit about them in these notes as well.The second part grapples with the actual nitty gritty details involved with actually coding in PyTorch.  I'll tell you how to cut your way through swaths of autograd code, what code actually matters and what is legacy, and also all of the cool tools that PyTorch gives you for writing kernels.The tensor is the central data structure in PyTorch.  You probably have a pretty good idea about what a tensor intuitively represents: its an n-dimensional data structure containing some sort of scalar type, e.g., floats, ints, et cetera.  We can think of a tensor as consisting of some data, and then some metadata describing the size of the tensor, the type of the elements in contains (dtype), what device the tensor lives on (CPU memory? CUDA memory?)There's also a little piece of metadata you might be less familiar with: the stride.  Strides are actually one of the distinctive features of PyTorch, so it's worth discussing them a little more.A tensor is a mathematical concept.  But to represent it on our computers, we have to define some sort of physical representation for them.  The most common representation is to lay out each element of the tensor contiguously in memory (that's where the term contiguous comes from), writing out each row to memory, as you see above. In the example above, I've specified that the tensor contains 32-bit integers, so you can see that each integer lies in a physical address, each offset four bytes from each other.  To remember what the actual dimensions of the tensor are, we have to also record what the sizes are as extra metadata.So, what do strides have to do with this picture?Suppose that I want to access the element at position  in my logical representation.  How do I translate this logical position into a location in physical memory?  Strides tell me how to do this: to find out where any element for a tensor lives, I multiply each index with the respective stride for that dimension, and sum them all together.  In the picture above, I've color coded the first dimension blue and the second dimension red, so you can follow the index and stride in the stride calculation.  Doing this sum, I get two (zero-indexed), and indeed, the number three lives two below the beginning of the contiguous array.(Later in the talk, I'll talk about TensorAccessor, a convenience class that handles the indexing calculation.  When you use TensorAccessor, rather than raw pointers, this calculation is handled under the covers for you.)Strides are the fundamental basis of how we provide views to PyTorch users.  For example, suppose that I want to extract out a tensor that represents the second row of the tensor above:Using advanced indexing support, I can just write  to get this row.  Here's the important thing: when I do this, I don't create a new tensor; instead, I just return a tensor which is a different view on the underlying data.  This means that if I, for example, edit the data in that view, it will be reflected in the original tensor.  In this case, it's not too hard to see how to do this: three and four live in contiguous memory, and all we need to do is record an offset saying that the data of this (logical) tensor lives two down from the top.  (Every tensor records an offset, but most of the time it's zero, and I'll omit it from my diagrams when that's the case.)Question from the talk: If I take a view on a tensor, how do I free the memory of the underlying tensor?Answer: You have to make a copy of the view, thus disconnecting it from the original physical memory.  There's really not much else you can do.  By the way, if you have written Java in the old days, taking substrings of strings has a similar problem, because by default no copy is made, so the substring retains the (possibly very large string). Apparently, they fixed this in Java 7u6.A more interesting case is if I want to take the first column:When we look at the physical memory, we see that the elements of the column are not contiguous: there's a gap of one element between each one.  Here, strides come to the rescue: instead of specifying a stride of one, we specify a stride of two, saying that between one element and the next, you need to jump two slots.  (By the way, this is why it's called a "stride": if we think of an index as walking across the layout, the stride says how many locations we stride forward every time we take a step.)The stride representation can actually let you represent all sorts of interesting views on tensors; if you want to play around with the possibilities, check out the Stride Visualizer.Let's step back for a moment, and think about how we would actually implement this functionality (after all, this is an internals talk.)  If we can have views on tensor, this means we have to decouple the notion of the tensor (the user-visible concept that you know and love), and the actual physical data that stores the data of the tensor (called storage):There may be multiple tensors which share the same storage.  Storage defines the dtype and physical size of the tensor, while each tensor records the sizes, strides and offset, defining the logical interpretation of the physical memory.One thing to realize is that there is always a pair of Tensor-Storage, even for "simple" cases where you don't really need a storage (e.g., you just allocated a contiguous tensor with ).
By the way, we're interested in making this picture not true; instead of having a separate concept of storage, just define a view to be a tensor that is backed by a base tensor.  This is a little more complicated, but it has the benefit that contiguous tensors get a much more direct representation without the Storage indirection.  A change like this would make PyTorch's internal representation a bit more like Numpy's.We've talked quite a bit about the data layout of tensor (some might say, if you get the data representation right, everything else falls in place).  But it's also worth briefly talking about how operations on the tensor are implemented.  At the very most abstract level, when you call , two dispatches happen:The first dispatch is based on the device type and layout of a tensor: e.g., whether or not it is a CPU tensor or a CUDA tensor (and also, e.g., whether or not it is a strided tensor or a sparse one).  This is a dynamic dispatch: it's a virtual function call (exactly where that virtual function call occurs will be the subject of the second half of this talk).  It should make sense that you need to do a dispatch here: the implementation of CPU matrix multiply is quite different from a CUDA implementation.  It is a  dispatch because these kernels may live in separate libraries (e.g.,  versus ), and so you have no choice: if you want to get into a library that you don't have a direct dependency on, you have to dynamic dispatch your way there.The second dispatch is a dispatch on the dtype in question.  This dispatch is just a simple switch-statement for whatever dtypes a kernel chooses to support.  Upon reflection, it should also make sense that we need to a dispatch here: the CPU code (or CUDA code, as it may) that implements multiplication on  is different from the code for .  It stands to reason you need separate kernels for each dtype.This is probably the most important mental picture to have in your head, if you're trying to understand the way operators in PyTorch are invoked.  We'll return to this picture when it's time to look more at code.Since we have been talking about Tensor, I also want to take a little time to the world of tensor extensions.  After all, there's more to life than dense, CPU float tensors.  There's all sorts of interesting extensions going on, like XLA tensors, or quantized tensors, or MKL-DNN tensors, and one of the things we have to think about, as a tensor library, is how to accommodate these extensions.Our current model for extensions offers four extension points on tensors.  First, there is the trinity three parameters which uniquely determine what a tensor is:The , the description of where the tensor's physical memory is actually stored, e.g., on a CPU, on an NVIDIA GPU (cuda), or perhaps on an AMD GPU (hip) or a TPU (xla).  The distinguishing characteristic of a device is that it has its own allocator, that doesn't work with any other device.The , which describes how we logically interpret this physical memory.  The most common layout is a strided tensor, but sparse tensors have a different layout involving a pair of tensors, one for indices, and one for data; MKL-DNN tensors may have even more exotic layout, like blocked layout, which can't be represented using merely strides.The , which describes what it is that is actually stored in each element of the tensor.  This could be floats or integers, or it could be, for example, quantized integers.If you want to add an extension to PyTorch tensors (by the way, if that's what you want to do, please talk to us!  None of these things can be done out-of-tree at the moment), you should think about which of these parameters you would extend.  The Cartesian product of these parameters define all of the possible tensors you can make.  Now, not all of these combinations may actually have kernels (who's got kernels for sparse, quantized tensors on FPGA?) but in  the combination could make sense, and thus we support expressing it, at the very least.There's one last way you can make an "extension" to Tensor functionality, and that's write a wrapper class around PyTorch tensors that implements your object type.  This perhaps sounds obvious, but sometimes people reach for extending one of the three parameters when they should have just made a wrapper class instead.  One notable merit of wrapper classes is they can be developed entirely out of tree.When should you write a tensor wrapper, versus extending PyTorch itself?  The key test is whether or not you need to pass this tensor along during the autograd backwards pass.  This test, for example, tells us that sparse tensor should be a true tensor extension, and not just a Python object that contains an indices and values tensor: when doing optimization on networks involving embeddings, we want the gradient generated by the embedding to be sparse.Our philosophy on extensions also has an impact of the data layout of tensor itself.  One thing we really want out of our tensor struct is for it to have a fixed layout: we don't want fundamental (and very frequently called) operations like "What's the size of a tensor?" to require virtual dispatches.  So when you look at the actual layout of a Tensor (defined in the TensorImpl struct),  what we see is a common prefix of all fields that we consider all "tensor"-like things to universally have, plus a few fields that are only really applicable for strided tensors, but are  important that we've kept them in the main struct, and then a suffix of custom fields that can be done on a per-Tensor basis.  Sparse tensors, for example, store their indices and values in this suffix.I told you all about tensors, but if that was the only thing PyTorch provided, we'd basically just be a Numpy clone.  The distinguishing characteristic of PyTorch when it was originally released was that it provided automatic differentiation on tensors (these days, we have other cool features like TorchScript; but back then, this was it!)What does automatic differentiation do?  It's the machinery that's responsible for taking a neural network:...and fill in the missing code that actually computes the gradients of your network:Take a moment to study this diagram.  There's a lot to unpack; here's what to look at:First, rest your eyes on the variables in red and blue.  PyTorch implements reverse-mode automatic differentiation, which means that we effectively walk the forward computations "backward" to compute the gradients.  You can see this if you look at the variable names: at the bottom of the red, we compute ; then, the first thing we do in the blue part of the program is compute .   was computed from , so we compute .  Technically, these variables which we call  are not really gradients; they're really Jacobians left-multiplied by a vector, but in PyTorch we just call them  and mostly everyone knows what we mean.If the structure of the code stays the same, the behavior doesn't: each line from forwards is replaced with a different computation, that represents the derivative of the forward operation.  For example, the  operation is translated into a  operation (these two lines are connected via a grey line on the left hand side of the diagram).  The inputs and outputs of the forward and backward operations are swapped: if the forward operation produced , the backward operation takes  as an input.The whole point of autograd is to do the computation that is described by this diagram, but without actually ever generating this source.  PyTorch autograd doesn't do a source-to-source transformation (though PyTorch JIT does know how to do symbolic differentiation).To do this, we need to store more metadata when we carry out operations on tensors.  Let's adjust our picture of the tensor data structure: now instead of just a tensor which points to a storage, we now have a variable which wraps this tensor, and also stores more information (AutogradMeta), which is needed for performing autograd when a user calls  in their PyTorch script.
This is yet another slide which will hopefully be out of date in the near future.  Will Feng is working on a Variable-Tensor merge in C++, following a simple merge which happened to PyTorch's frontend interface.We also have to update our picture about dispatch:Before we dispatch to CPU or CUDA implementations, there is another dispatch on variables, which is responsible for unwrapping variables, calling the underlying implementation (in green), and then rewrapping the results into variables and recording the necessary autograd metadata for backwards.Some implementations don't unwrap; they just call into other variable implementations.  So you might spend a while in the Variable universe.  However, once you unwrap and go into the non-Variable Tensor universe, that's it; you never go back to Variable (except by returning from your function.)In my NY meetup talk, I skipped the following seven slides.  I'm also going to delay writeup for them; you'll have to wait for the sequel for some text.Enough about concepts, let's look at some code.PyTorch has a lot of folders, and there is a very detailed description of what they are in the CONTRIBUTING document, but really, there are only four directories you really need to know about:First,  contains what you are most familiar with: the actual Python modules that you import and use.  This stuff is Python code and easy to hack on (just make a change and see what happens).  However, lurking not too deep below the surface is..., the C++ code that implements what you might call the frontend of PyTorch.  In more descriptive terms, it implements the binding code that translates between the Python and C++ universe, and also some pretty important pieces of PyTorch, like the autograd engine and the JIT compiler.  It also contains the C++ frontend code., short for "A Tensor Library" (coined by Zachary DeVito), is a C++ library that implements the operations of Tensors.  If you're looking for where some kernel code lives, chances are it's in ATen.  ATen itself bifurcates into two neighborhoods of operators: the "native" operators, which are modern, C++ implementations of operators, and the "legacy" operators (TH, THC, THNN, THCUNN), which are legacy, C implementations.  The legacy operators are the bad part of town; try not to spend too much time there if you can., which is a pun on Caffe2 and A"Ten" (get it? Caffe 10) contains the core abstractions of PyTorch, including the actual implementations of the Tensor and Storage data structures.That's a lot of places to look for code; we should probably simplify the directory structure, but that's how it is.  If you're trying to work on operators, you'll spend most of your time in .Let's see how this separation of code breaks down in practice:When you call a function like , what actually happens?  If you remember the discussion we had about dispatching, you already have the basic picture in your head:We have to translate from Python realm to the C++ realm (Python argument parsing)We handle  dispatch (VariableType--Type, by the way, doesn't really have anything to do programming language types, and is just a gadget for doing dispatch.)We handle  dispatch (Type)We have the actual kernel, which is either a modern native function, or a legacy TH function.Each of these steps corresponds concretely to some code.  Let's cut our way through the jungle.Our initial landing point in the C++ code is the C implementation of a Python function, which we've exposed to the Python side as something like .   is the implementation of one such implementation.One important thing to know about this code is that it is auto-generated.  If you search in the GitHub repository, you won't find it, because you have to actually build PyTorch to see it.  Another important thing is, you don't have to really deeply understand what this code is doing; the idea is to skim over it and get a sense for what it is doing.  Above, I've annotated some of the most important bits in blue: you can see that there is a use of a class  to actually pull out C++ objects out of the Python  and ; we then call a  function (which I've inlined in red); this releases the global interpreter lock and then calls a plain old method on the C++ Tensor .  On its way back, we rewrap the returned  back into a .(At this point, there's an error in the slides: I'm supposed to tell you about the Variable dispatch code.  I haven't fixed it here yet.  Some magic happens, then...)When we call the  method on the  class, no virtual dispatch happens yet.  Instead, we have an inline method which calls a virtual method on a "Type" object.  This method is the actual virtual method (this is why I say Type is just a "gadget" that gets you dynamic dispatch.)  In the particular case of this example, this virtual call dispatches to an implementation of add on a class named .  This happens to be because we have an implementation of  that is the same for every device type (both CPU and CUDA); if we had happened to have different implementations, we might have instead landed on something like .  It is this implementation of the virtual method that finally gets us to the actual kernel code.
Hopefully, this slide will be out-of-date very soon too; Roy Li is working on replacing  dispatch with another mechanism which will help us better support PyTorch on mobile.It's worth reemphasizing that all of the code, until we got to the kernel, is automatically generated.It's a bit twisty and turny, so once you have some basic orientation about what's going on, I recommend just jumping straight to the kernels.PyTorch offers a lot of useful tools for prospective kernel writers.  In this section, we'll walk through a few of them.  But first of all, what do you need to write a kernel?We generally think of a kernel in PyTorch consisting of the following parts:First, there's some metadata which we write about the kernel, which powers the code generation and lets you get all the bindings to Python, without having to write a single line of code.Once you've gotten to the kernel, you're past the device type / layout dispatch. The first thing you need to write is error checking, to make sure the input tensors are the correct dimensions.  (Error checking is really important!  Don't skimp on it!)Next, we generally have to allocate the result tensor which we are going to write the output into.Time for the kernel proper.  At this point, you now should do the second, dtype dispatch, to jump into a kernel which is specialized per dtype it operates on.  (You don't want to do this too early, because then you will be uselessly duplicating code that looks the same in any case.)Most performant kernels need some sort of parallelization, so that you can take advantage of multi-CPU systems.  (CUDA kernels are "implicitly" parallelized, since their programming model is built on top of massive parallelization).Finally, you need to access the data and do the computation you wanted to do!In the subsequent slides, we'll walk through some of the tools PyTorch has for helping you implementing these steps.To take advantage of all of the code generation which PyTorch brings, you need to write a  for your operator.  The schema gives a mypy-esque type of your function, and also controls whether or not we generate bindings for methods or functions on Tensor.  You also tell the schema what implementations of your operator should be called for given device-layout combinations.  Check out the README in native is for more information about this format.Error checking can be done by way of either a low level or a high level API.  The low level API is just a macro, , which takes a boolean, and then any number of arguments to make up the error string to render if the boolean is not true.  One nice thing about this macro is that you can intermix strings with non-string data; everything is formatted using their implementation of , and most important data types in PyTorch have  implementations.The high level API saves you from having to write up repetitive error messages over and over again.  The way it works is you first wrap each  into a , which contains information about where the tensor came from (e.g., its argument name).  It then provides a number of pre-canned functions for checking various properties; e.g.,  tests if the tensor's dimensionality is a fixed number.  If it's not, the function provides a user-friendly error message based on the  metadata.One important thing to be aware about when writing operators in PyTorch, is that you are often signing up to write  operators: , which operates on a preallocated output (this implements the  keyword argument), , which operates inplace, and , which is the plain old functional version of an operator.Most of the time,  is the real workhorse, and  and  are just thin wrappers around ; but sometimes writing specialized implementations for each case are warranted.To do dtype dispatch, you should use the  macro.  This takes in the dtype of the tensor you want to dispatch over, and a lambda which will be specialized for each dtype that is dispatchable from the macro.  Usually, this lambda just calls a templated helper function.This macro doesn't just "do dispatch", it also decides what dtypes your kernel will support.  As such, there are actually quite a few versions of this macro, which let you pick different subsets of dtypes to generate specializations for.  Most of the time, you'll just want , but keep an eye out for situations when you might want to dispatch to some more types.  There's guidance in Dispatch.h for how to select the correct one for your use-case.On CPU, you frequently want to parallelize your code.  In the past, this was usually done by directly sprinkling OpenMP pragmas in your code.At some point, we have to actually access the data.  PyTorch offers quite a few options for doing this.If you just want to get a value at some specific location, you should use .  A tensor accessor is like a tensor, but it hard codes the dimensionality and dtype of the tensor as template parameters.  When you retrieve an accessor like , we do a runtime test to make sure that the tensor really is this format; but after that, every access is unchecked.  Tensor accessors handle strides correctly, so you should prefer using them over raw pointer access (which, unfortunately, some legacy kernels do.)  There is also a , which is specifically useful for sending an accessor over a CUDA launch, so that you can get accessors from inside your CUDA kernel.  (One notable gotcha:  defaults to 64-bit indexing, which is much slower than 32-bit indexing in CUDA!)If you're writing some sort of operator with very regular element access, for example, a pointwise operation, you are much better off using a higher level of abstraction, the .   This helper class automatically handles broadcasting and type promotion for you, and is quite handy.For true speed on CPU, you may need to write your kernel using vectorized CPU instructions.  We've got helpers for that too!  The  class represents a vector of scalars and provides a number of methods which perform vectorized operations on them all at once.  Helpers like  then let you easily run vectorized operations, and then finish everything that doesn't round nicely into vector instructions using plain old instructions.  The infrastructure here also manages compiling your kernel multiple times under different instruction sets, and then testing at runtime what instructions your CPU supports, and using the best kernel in those situations.A lot of kernels in PyTorch are still written in the legacy TH style.  (By the way, TH stands for TorcH.  It's a pretty nice acronym, but unfortunately it is a bit poisoned; if you see TH in the name, assume that it's legacy.)  What do I mean by the legacy TH style?It's written in C style, no (or very little) use of C++.It's manually refcounted (with manual calls to  to decrease refcounts when you're done using tensors), andIt lives in  directory, which means that we are actually going to compile the file multiple times, but with different .This code is pretty crazy, and we hate reviewing it, so please don't add to it.  One of the more useful tasks that you can do, if you like to code but don't know too much about kernel writing, is to port some of these TH functions to ATen.To wrap up, I want to talk a little bit about working efficiently on PyTorch.  If the largeness of PyTorch's C++ codebase is the first gatekeeper that stops people from contributing to PyTorch, the efficiency of your workflow is the second gatekeeper.  If you try to work on C++ with Python habits, : it will take forever to recompile PyTorch, and it will take you forever to tell if your changes worked or not.How to work efficiently could probably be a talk in and of itself, but this slide calls out some of the most common anti-patterns I've seen when someone complains: "It's hard to work on PyTorch."If you edit a header, especially one that is included by many source files (and especially if it is included by CUDA files), expect a very long rebuild.  Try to stick to editing cpp files, and edit headers sparingly!Our CI is a very wonderful, zero-setup way to test if your changes worked or not. But expect to wait an hour or two before you get back signal.  If you are working on a change that will require lots of experimentation, spend the time setting up a local development environment.  Similarly, if you run into a hard to debug problem on a specific CI configuration, set it up locally.  You can download and run the Docker images locallyThe CONTRIBUTING guide explains how to setup ccache; this is highly recommended, because sometimes it will help you get lucky and avoid a massive recompile when you edit a header.  It also helps cover up bugs in our build system, when we recompile files when we shouldn't.At the end of the day, we have a lot of C++ code, and you will have a much more pleasant experience if you build on a beefy server with CPUs and RAM.  In particular, I don't recommend doing CUDA builds on a laptop; building CUDA is sloooooow and laptops tend to not have enough juice to turnaround quickly enough.So that's it for a whirlwind tour of PyTorch's internals!  Many, many things have been omitted; but hopefully the descriptions and explanations here can help you get a grip on at least a substantial portion of the codebase.Where should you go from here?  What kinds of contributions can you make?  A good place to start is our issue tracker.  Starting earlier this year, we have been triaging issues; issues labeled  mean that at least one PyTorch developer has looked at it and made an initial assessment about the issue.

The reports specifically address the EU's Cyber Resilience Act (or CRA) and "highlight knowledge gaps and best practices for CRA compliance." 

"Unaware and Uncertain: The Stark Realities of CRA-Readiness in Open Source" includes a survey which found that when it comes to CRA requirements, 62% of respondents were either "not familiar at all" (36%) or "slightly familiar" (26%) — while 51% weren't sure about its deadlines. ("Only 28% correctly identified 2027 as the target year for full compliance," according to one infographic, which adds that CRA "is expected to drive a 6% average price increase, though 53% of manufacturers are still assessing pricing impacts.")

Manufacturers, who bear primary responsibility, lack readiness — many [46%] passively rely on upstream security fixes, and only a small portion produce Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs). The report recommends that manufacturers take a more active role in open source security, that more funding and legal support is needed to support security practices, and that clear regulatory guidance is essential to prevent unintended negative impacts on open source development.
 

The research also provides "an in-depth analysis of how open collaboration can strengthen software security and innovation across global markets," with another report that "examines how three Linux Foundation projects are meeting the CRA's minimum compliance requirements" and "provides insight on the elements needed to ensure leadership in cybersecurity best practices." (It also includes CRA-related resources.) 

"These two reports offer actionable conclusions for open source stakeholders to ready themselves for 2027, when the CRA comes into force," according to a Linux Foundation reserach executive cited in the announcement. "We hope that these reports catalyze higher levels of collaboration across the open source community."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NASA&apos;S Plutonium Problem</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geIhl_VE0IA</link><author>Real Engineering</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/geIhl_VE0IA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 14:31:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR1IuLEqb6UEA_zQ81kwXfg">Real Engineering</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Get Nebula for 50% off with my link: https://go.nebula.tv/realengineering

They’re a type of wetland, basically an ecosystem that is covered in water. But the water in peatlands doesn’t have much oxygen, which keeps dead organic matter from breaking down completely. 🌱 
 
That’s great news for the climate! Instead of releasing a bunch of CO2 during decomposition, peatlands store all that carbon in a wet and mossy vault. 🔒 
 
But the stored CO2 can be easily released again if the peatlands are destroyed or dried up. 🏭

AI systems do not just chat anymore; they act. Instead of merely suggesting an action, an advanced AI system can execute the action itself. ChatGPT’s latest features exemplify this shift: it  using tools like web browsers and databases. In other words, an AI agent can carry out multi-step jobs end-to-end. These agents are now seen as an  augmenting human teams. A support bot might not only draft a reply but also send it and update records on its own, and not just through API but through a web interface. 🫣CUA and OpenAI’s Responses API: Building Agentic AITo develop action-oriented AI systems, many organizations are rolling out new frameworks. OpenAI, for instance, just introduced tools for  applications, including a Responses API that pairs GPT-style language skills with built-in web search, file handling, and a  (CUA) to operate the software. In practice, an AI using these tools could fill out forms or update databases by itself. OpenAI also released an Agents SDK to orchestrate such workflows and made it open-source. Similarly, open-source projects like open-cuak and browser-use provide -style automation without proprietary fees. These efforts lower the barrier to creating AI agents that can not only think but also act on a user’s behalf.Large Action Models (LAMs): Beyond Language to ExecutionAn LAM is essentially a large AI model (basically a fined-tuned multi-modal LLM) that doesn’t just understand language – it can  things in response. Think of it as the  of a large language model. Where a traditional assistant might tell you how to solve a problem, a LAM-powered system could actually carry out the solution for you. This represents a major shift, potentially allowing AI to automate entire processes rather than just generate content. LAMs do this by combining language understanding with decision-making and tool use. \
By turning AI from a passive responder into an active problem-solver, they unlock new possibilities – but also demand greater reliability, since mistakes by an agent that acts can have real consequences.The Dead Internet Theory and AI SaturationOne side effect of these agentic advances is a flood of AI-generated content online. This has revived the Dead Internet Theory, which claims much of today’s online content is produced by bots rather than people. In 2025, that idea feels eerily plausible. A significant portion of tweets, posts, and even news articles are now machine-generated, blurring the line between genuine human voices and automated output. Conclusion: Balancing Potential With OversightThe evolution of AI into autonomous agents brings great promise – and calls for prudence. On one hand, these agents can handle drudge work and complex tasks at lightning speed, freeing people to focus on creativity and strategy. On the other hand, giving AI the freedom to act means setting clear . \
As some experts warn, AI’s impact could  depending on how responsibly we guide it. That may sound extreme, but it underscores the importance of oversight. Accordingly, developers and policymakers are crafting safety guidelines to keep agentic AI aligned with human values.\
Keeping a  for critical decisions remains vital. Ultimately, it’s about balance: harnessing AI’s potential to act on our behalf, while ensuring humans retain final control. If we get it right, autonomous agents could become invaluable partners – powerful, yet .Feature Image is generated with Google's ImageFX]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Aerials show site of fire that caused 18-hour shutdown of Heathrow Airport</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AUKU1MXcyo</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/-AUKU1MXcyo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 14:15:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[While Heathrow reopened on Saturday, airlines warned that severe disruption will last for days as they scramble to relocate planes and crews and get travelers to their destinations.

Stakeholders Want Everything. Your Team Can’t Do It All.Agile is a tightrope walk. One moment, you’re helping the team hit their sprint goal. The next, a stakeholder drops in with a  that could throw everything off balance.If you push back, you risk frustrating them. If you say yes, you overload the team and compromise quality.If you work in an agile environment—especially as a BA, PM, or Scrum Master—you know the drill. You’re constantly managing expectations, juggling priorities, and, let’s be honest, playing  against scope creep. If you don’t learn to , you’ll either:✅ End up in , where every new request delays progress.❌ Be labeled as , even though you’re just keeping things under control.Neither is great. But here’s the good news: you can say no—without making enemies or derailing projects.Saying No is Hard, But Saying Yes to Everything is WorseLet’s face it: no one enjoys being told “no.” Especially stakeholders who:Think everything is .Believe adding “just one more thing” is simple (spoiler: it’s usually not).Have leadership breathing down their necks for faster delivery.Saying  means missed deadlines, exhausted teams, and a bloated product roadmap.Saying  makes people feel ignored—or worse, they escalate their request to leadership.Your job isn’t to —it’s to manage them strategically so the team stays focused on what truly matters.The Right Way to Push Back (Without Sounding Like a Roadblock)🔥 Tactical Framework: The “A.R.O” Method (Align, Redirect, Offer) 🔥Instead of just , use this  to keep things positive and solution-focused:1️⃣ Align → Show You Understand Their RequestBefore you push back, acknowledge the request. Make the stakeholders feel heard.✅ “That’s a great idea—I see how that could help [business goal].”✅“I get why this is important, and I know it would improve [specific use case].”🎯  Because people hate being dismissed. A little validation  in keeping the conversation productive.A stakeholder once requested a custom email template/update to an existing template in the middle of a sprint. Instead of shutting it down, I responded:✔“Customizing text makes the template more relevant and effective—I see why this matters. (ALIGN)."✔“Right now, we’re focused on completing the current tasks in the sprint, and adding this would delay that release. (REDIRECT)."✔“But we can review this in backlog refinement and see where it fits best. (OFFER).”They didn’t love the answer—but they understood the trade-off, and that’s what mattered.2️⃣ Redirect → Shift Focus to Priorities & ConstraintsOnce they feel heard, gently guide the conversation back to the team’s existing commitments.❌ Instead of: “We don’t have time for this.”✅ Say: “Right now, we’re committed to [priority feature], and adding this would push back that timeline.”OR, if leadership is involved:✅“I’d love to explore this! But based on our roadmap, it would require shifting priorities. Would you like to discuss what we can trade-off?”🎯  Because this turns the conversation into a prioritization discussion instead of a hard rejection.3️⃣ Offer → Find a Path Forward (That Doesn’t Derail Everything)Stakeholders don’t just want an answer—they want . Even if you can’t say yes, offer .✔ “We can look at this for the next sprint.”✔“If we deprioritize [X], we might be able to fit this in. Is that an option?”✔“We can do a lightweight version now and expand on it later. Would that work?”🎯  Because this keeps the conversation  rather than combative.Handling Difficult Stakeholders (Because Some Won’t Take No for an Answer)Even if you use this approach, some stakeholders  Here’s how to handle the most common scenarios:📌 Scenario 1: “I need this ASAP.”🚀 “I hear you. Let’s look at trade-offs—what are you okay with delaying so we can fit this in?”👉Forces them to recognize the impact of their request instead of assuming it can just be added in.I once had a feature request to add/copy over an existing feature for a different set of users right before the launch of the application. Instead of rejecting it, I asked:✔“If we prioritize this, it means delaying the feature your team requested in the last sprint. Do you want to make that trade?”Once they realized the impact, 📌 Scenario 2: They Go Around You to Leadership.💡 “I understand why this is important. Let’s get leadership involved so we can collectively decide how to prioritize it.”👉This keeps the conversation structured instead of turning it into a conflict.📌 Scenario 3: They Keep Changing Requirements Mid-Sprint.⏳ “I get that priorities shift, but once a sprint starts, any changes need to be considered for the next sprint so we don’t disrupt progress. Let’s queue this up for the backlog.”👉This reinforces that agile is structured, not an on-the-fly request system.Your Playbook for Handling Stakeholders Like a ProWant to make these conversations easier? Set expectations before they become a problem.✅ Create a Transparent Roadmap→ If stakeholders know what’s planned, they’re less likely to demand last-minute changes.✅ → Instead of  say “This request would take ~4 weeks, which would push back [X].”✅Make Prioritization a Shared Responsibility → If they want to add something, they should help decide what gets cut.Final Thoughts: Saying No is About Protecting Value, Not Rejecting IdeasAgile BAs aren’t note-takers—they’re decision facilitators.✅ Your job isn’t to say no—it’s to make sure the right things get built at the right time.✅ The more strategic you are in these conversations, the more respect you earn from both stakeholders and your team.✅ Saying no isn’t rejection—it’s guiding stakeholders toward better decisions.I know every BA has a war story about pushing back on a wild stakeholder request. What’s yours? What’s the toughest ‘no’ you’ve ever had to deliver? Let’s hear it in the comments!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The 20 hottest open source startups of 2024</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/22/the-20-hottest-open-source-startups-of-2024/</link><author>Paul Sawers</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A new report showcases the 20 top-trending open source startups around the world, more than half of which are closely aligned with AI.

Primary features are:Easy to use: it has a simple API for everyday use that can handle several use cases.Lightweight: performance similar to sqlx and only one dependency (it uses scany under the hood to do the scanning job, which is also well optimized).Support for non-english utf-8 characters in named queries.It has only 3 main methods that can handle different use cases:go Query(ctx context.Context, dst any, query string, args ...any) error QueryRow(ctx context.Context, dst any, query string, args ...any) error Exec(ctx context.Context, query string, args ...any) (sql.Result, error) Both / execute the query and scan the returned rows into the  parameter, it works with default or named placeholders, passing a struct or map as  works as a named query. is similar, passing array/slice as  will be treated as a batch insert.Let me know what y'all think, specially the API, do you think it's better to have a separate method for named queries? Been using it and it feels nice but want some inputs.Obvious question so I'll answer in advance. I've been using sqlx for some time, and while it's miles ahead the stdlib, I feel it's too verbose for simple cases, e.g. can't use 'IN' clause with named queries directly, gotta first use sqlx.Named, handle the error, then sqlx.In, handle the error, then Rebind, then Select.An abstraction on top of sqlx is not fun, so I took the opportunity to learn and created sqlz, which turned out pretty good.Performance-wise, it's close to sqlx, you can see results here (lower delta is better for sqlz).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Most Disappointing Movie Sequels Of All Time</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/the-most-disappointing-movie-sequels-of-all-time?source=rss</link><author>Fayam Ayekame</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 13:45:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Sequels offer fans a chance to return to their favorite movies, even allowing writers to expand their universes. While they are typically a great idea, sometimes things don’t work out the way anyone expects. Some sequels are a letdown, with some even ruining the franchise. Here are some movie sequels that were a letdown:Ghost Rider: Spirit Of VengeanceNicholas Cage was one of the biggest stars of the 2000s, with Ghost Rider being one of his most popular works. Ghost Rider may not be a part of the MCU, but it certainly paved the way for some of the later successes. Ghost Rider seemingly ends perfectly with the defeat of Blackheart and the defiance of the Devil.\
Ghost Rider: Spirit Of Vengeance was an unnecessary sequel, and it failed the original movie in more ways than one. From the poor CGI to plot holes, there was little to desire about the sequel. The sequel was so bad that many fans didn’t even realize one was made, further making the case that it should never have happened.The Scorpion King (Multiple Sequels)The Scorpion King was a huge success, thanks in no small part to Dwayne Johnson’s presence. Any sequels without the main attraction were always going to come short, and that’s exactly what happened. With four sequels to follow the original, almost every possible plotline has been explored, to no avail.\
Every new entry into the franchise seems to hit new lows, with people less interested in Mathayus’s story. The producers should have just stopped at the first movie and left the fans to their imaginations.Mean Girls is one of the most iconic movies of the 2000s, with a star-studded cast featuring Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams. With a seemingly perfect ending where lessons are learned and all seems right with the world, there was no real need for a sequel. This fact is reflected in the low ratings and viewership of the sequel, with most people seeing it as more of the same.\
There has even been a remake of the original meeting a similar fate as the sequel. The original Movie remains an all-time classic and should remain unblemished by any sequels.R.I.P.D 2: Rise of the DamnedR.I.P.D 2: Rise of the Damned was damned from the get-go, with the absence of both leads from the original movie. To be fair, it is a passable stand-alone movie, but it pales in comparison to its predecessor. I doubt any movie could survive losing both Jeff Bridges and Ryan Reynolds.With the comedic interaction of the dynamic duo missing, most viewers weren’t even aware there was a sequel. The comedy seemed forced, and despite a passable plot, the movie just seemed off and a poor imitation of the first.The Mummy: Tomb Of The Dragon EmperorThe Mummy was always going to have sequels, and sure enough, there have been two to follow the original. While the second movie managed to be impressive and retain some of the magic of the first movie, the third left a lot to be desired.\
Despite boasting a star-studded cast including Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh, The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor was a letdown. Everything just seemed off from the start, and the film never got better as viewers went along. It’s one of those sequels we wish never happened, and we were left with the first two movies in the franchise.Van Wilder: The Rise of TajVan Wilder was the ultimate college movie of the 2000s, featuring the titular character as an enigmatic party boy. Creating a sequel around a minor character may have seemed like a good idea, but this concept proved to be wrong.\
The Rise of Taj focused on Van’s assistant as he attempted to establish himself at his new school with lessons he learned from his mentor. Not only did this sequel fail to capture the magic of the first movie, but it was worse than the next entry to the franchise.Megamind Vs. The Doom SyndicateThe idea of creating a sequel for the incredibly handsome criminal mastermind and master of all villainy was lovely. There were always going to be consequences for Megamind turning good and abandoning his evil ways, which we get to see in this sequel. His former villain team poses a problem to the now reformed Megamind in his new role as protector of Metro City.\
Unfortunately, this sequel failed to live up to the standards established by the first movie. With almost an entirely new cast, it is not difficult to see why viewers don’t appreciate the sequel as much as the original. It presents more as a kids’ story as opposed to one the entire family can enjoy and have a good laugh.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>At least 9 Palestinians killed in Gaza City after Israeli strikes on the territory</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgkBtKKfKFs</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/DgkBtKKfKFs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 13:36:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An Israeli airstrike killed at least nine Palestinians, including five members of the Al-Mashharawi family, in the Gaza Strip, hospital officials said Saturday.

I recently pushed new stage handlers that unlock a variety of new powerful async pipeline patterns. Some of these were ideas you guys had in the comments of my original post (thank you!).Most notable additions are `Merge` and `Option` stages. gliter.NewPipeline(streamFromRedis). Stage( preprocessFeatures, // Normalize, extract relevant fields ). Stage( runFraudModel, // Model inference on transactions checkBusinessRules, // Non-ML heuristic checks ). Merge( aggregateResults, // Combine outputs from ML & rules ). Stage( sendToAlertSystem, // Notify if fraud detected storeInDatabase, // Log for later analysis ). Run() The elevator pitch is: Gliter (Golang iter) enables Go developers to express complex and nuanced async patterns without having to manage races, deadlocks, channel states, and goroutine leaks.Actually just the other day, I encountered a deadlock scenario in some old code at work. If gliter becomes a thing, I can imagine a world where these types of painful bugs are much less common because the surface area of gnarly async code is reduced, centralized, and solved. That's what excites me about the project.Anyway, if you're curious to read more about why I built gliter and what I learned along the way, the original blog post from a few months back is here:Consider using gliter in your next project, I think you'll really enjoy it!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Would love to see people share their homelab/projects using k8s along with their diagram and techstack used</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1jh8b4j/would_love_to_see_people_share_their/</link><author>/u/mapoztofu</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>k8s</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 13:21:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I am very new to the K8 world(at theory phase right now and using rancher desktop for some hands on)and want to see and learn from folks here what projects they are working on along with their diagram.That would be very interesting and helpful.

ABSTRACT
In this explore the past, present and future of array programming languages. They are one of the most expressive and productive languages yet remain relatively unknown.T hey are still used heavily in financial markets globally. Array developers made the first wide spread use of learning by katas and patterns, then called idioms, and including the now pervasive map reduce. The dynamic Array languages originated with APL followed by APL2, NIAL, J and k.

Often considered high barrier languages, we argue that they are much like a challenging instrument that when mastered allow to make amazing music with seeming little effort. We will also discuss why Vector programming is a natural low impedance approach for dealing with today’s high performance NoSQL and NewSQL column stores.

In the late 60s and early 70s Fortran, Lisp, COBOL, APL and Basic were the hot languages. Lisp, APL and later Basic pioneered the “the repl” of interactive computing. APL provides an efficient array/vector language for numeric computing. and found wide acceptance in financial, engineering and statistical computing. APL inspired – the Smalltalk environment; array extensions in other general languages such as Python NumPy and NamedTuple; F-Script for IOS Cocoa; special purpose languages such as MatLab and R; to recent proposed extensions for value types in Java; along with special purpose vector hardware like GPUs and recent Intel AVX instructions.

The timing coincides with OpenAI's release of ChatGPT in late 2022. Anthropic researchers found people use AI to perform programming tasks more than those of any other job, though 57 percent of users employ AI to augment rather than automate work. "Without getting hysterical, the unemployment jump for programming really does look at least partly like an early, visible labor market effect of AI," said Mark Muro of the Brookings Institution. 

While software developer positions have remained stable with only a 0.3 percent decline, programmers who perform more routine coding from specifications provided by others have seen their ranks diminish to levels not seen since 1980. Economists caution that high interest rates and post-pandemic tech industry contraction have also contributed to the decline in programming jobs, which typically pay $99,700 compared to $132,270 for developers.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>KDE KWin Lands FIFO v1 Wayland Support, GNOME 48 Squeezed In XDG Toplevel Drag v1</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/KDE-KWin-Does-FIFO-v1</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 12:43:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[There is some new Wayland protocol support activity this week worth mentioning for both the KDE Plasma and GNOME desktops...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Police increases use of force as protests continue in Turkey</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1jh7inr/police_increases_use_of_force_as_protests/</link><author>/u/GMNtg128</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 12:38:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Great Introductory course</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1jh78g5/great_introductory_course/</link><author>/u/Far_Dimension_6413</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>k8s</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 12:22:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I highly suggest their basic of kubernetes course and it is free, but rancher-desktop is pretty heavy to use on my system, since my system is not that heavy to take a load.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>My first days with Rust from the perspective of an experienced C++ programmer (continued)</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1jh78e2/my_first_days_with_rust_from_the_perspective_of/</link><author>/u/Rough-Island6775</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 12:22:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Using AIs with questions such as how do I do this and that in Rust describing things that I know are there makes the transition smooth.What first seemed like elaborate syntax makes perfect sense and probably as good as it can be.I will read the Rust book and the reference to get formally educated but for now AI acts as a tutor answering things that it has seen plenty of times, noob questions.The binary is larger, as expected, primarily (I think) due to the initial data structure is built in a function instead of hard-coded as a global.Somewhat larger binary is expected and acceptable due to the built in safeties of Rust.Without AI the learning curve is a bit steep and for a programming noob is probably off-putting. For an experienced C++ programmer is just: "yeah, that's better" and it keeps giving me a tiny smile every time that happens.I begin to understand the cult like following Rust has because once a learning step in the curve is taken it feels like there is no going back.I have a lot to learn, but for now, for my toy bare-metal application, I feel that this is the way forward.p.s.

But with those choices, and billions of dollars being spent annually on ed tech, educators and school administrators say they also have a problem: There is no mandatory licensing process that certifies that ed tech products work as advertised or that they can be trusted with sensitive student information.\
Experts have called for countries to establish licensing bodies for educational technology, but for the time being, ed tech companies have largely been left to regulate themselves through voluntary, industry-funded certification programs.\
The result is that schools are using many products that may harm children. This week, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) released a report on global use of educational technology that warned, “Children’s privacy, safety and well-being are at risk due to lack of oversight of the education technology industry.” And last year a Human Rights Watch investigation found that many ed tech products endorsed by government agencies were potentially snooping on kids.\
For example, Edmodo, one of the companies identified in the report, once had 10,000,000 estimated users. It went out of business last year and has since been fined by the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission for illegally collecting and storing data about users under the age of 13. (Somewhat confusingly, UNESCO at one point recommended Edmodo for distance learning.)\
“We put more thought as institutions into buying tea bags than we do technology,” said Anne-Marie Scott, an open education advocate who previously led ed tech purchasing for universities in the U.K. and Canada. “We buy fair trade tea bags … and we buy utterly garbage proctoring systems.”\
While we can’t recommend what products are right for an individual school, we spoke to educators, procurement officers, and parents to gather their best advice and recommendations for evaluating the myriad products on offer. Here are the four critical questions they said students, parents, and educators should be asking.1. Will This Technology Help?Experts, practitioners, and parents we spoke to agreed that a school’s first step in buying new technology should be to pause and ask whether the tech is needed. Is the newest software or hardware the most effective solution for the school? Sometimes—perhaps because a new tool is suggested directly by an educator or salesperson—this step gets skipped.\
Holly Doe, director of technology for Maine’s Regional School Unit 40, said that she’s been shocked to learn how many different ed tech tools teachers in her small district started using during the pandemic. And the sales pitches haven’t stopped. “We get a lot of emails from vendors,” she said. “I’m flooded, flooded every day.”\
She and Sarah Radcliffe, director of future-ready learning for the School District of Altoona, in Wisconsin, said that keeping detailed inventories of what products teachers use, how they use them, how often they use them, and when the contracts expire has helped the district assess what its schools actually need. Teachers could do this through a survey, or, unsurprisingly, schools can buy ed tech systems to help them evaluate how much they use other ed tech.\
Both administrators also recommended that schools regularly survey their educators to ask how they’re using the products they have and what products they envision needing in the future.2. Can I Get a Demonstration?Scott, the former university technology officer, recommended that before a school begins a formal purchasing or request for proposal (RFP) process, it should examine the open source options available and then invite relevant vendors to demonstrate their tools for a group of educators, students, and IT staff. The demonstrations allow procurement officers to take note of what different products on the market can do and how they fit the specific use cases of the school’s community. With that information, the school can craft a more informed RFP and not wind up in a long-term contract for a product that ticked the boxes on paper but doesn’t meet real-world needs.\
“I like to have students in the procurement team,” Scott said. “There’s nothing like a student sitting in the room to change the way a supplier talks about their product. They can’t rely on lazy stereotypes of what students are.”\
Doe, from RSU 40, said she always tries to get demo samples of hardware or software licenses so that her teachers can pilot products before the district makes a larger purchase.\
“If you don’t actually experience it, I suppose you don’t really know,” she said.\
Once a school has conducted its research, it should share that information with parents so that they too can understand and trust the technologies their children are using, said Cassie Creswell, a Chicago parent and co-chair of the Parent Coalition for Student Privacy,“[Schools] need to share basic information with parents,” she said. “If they don’t, you can’t really have any confidence that they’re doing that due diligence to pick the contractor in the first place.”\
The Parent Coalition for Student Privacy has created a toolkit to help parents get informed and involved in their schools’ technology decisions.3. What Do the Reviews Say?Once a school has decided it needs a new technology, it has to decide which specific product to purchase, often choosing from dozens of similar options.\
Velislava Hillman, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and Political Science who researches ed tech procurement, said the lack of national licensing programs for ed tech makes it difficult for schools to know which products are tested and proven and which are snake oil.\
Educators and administrators rely on peer networks to fill that information gap. But Hillman said there are two affiliated databases that share rigorous evaluations, benchmarking, and peer reviews of ed tech products:\
EdTech Impact This database is a partnership between industry, academics, and other experts that provides basic information about products (such as their compatible systems, pricing, and competitors) as well as standardized evaluations from school leaders on such questions as: Does the product improve educational attainment? Does it reduce teacher workload?\
Education Alliance Finland certifications This Finnish organization uses teacher reviewers to evaluate ed tech products on pedagogical criteria such as: What learning goals is the product intended to meet? Does it help students meet those goals? Does the product engage students in passive or active learning?It can be hard to get the largest ed tech vendors to adjust their standard contracts on important issues like data privacy. But educators say it’s worth trying.\
Doe said ed tech vendors are often “telling me what I need” rather than the other way around. “It can be really tough to get those big vendors to sign those [data privacy] agreements,” she added.\
The answer, for RSU 40 and many other schools, has been to organize. In many regions, districts or universities have joined together to purchase ed tech products as a group, pooling their influence over potential vendors. RSU 40 and many other K-12 districts have also joined the Student Data Privacy Consortium and its associated state chapters.\
The consortium provides example data privacy agreements and hosts a database of vendors used by participating districts. Radcliffe,  the future-ready learning director in Altoona, said some vendors will balk at signing a privacy agreement with a new district, so she uses the database to show them that they’ve already agreed to the same terms with other clients.\
Creswell, the Chicago parent and advocate, said organized parents and students can also be effective when district officials aren’t.\
She and other Chicago parents helped lead a successful campaign in 2021 that persuaded the district to amend its contract with College Board and other companies so that the vendors could no longer prompt students to agree to data sharing agreements (by clicking “Accept” on a website, for example) beyond what was allowed in the vendors’ contracts with the district.\
“You shouldn’t be forced to hand over sensitive data in order for your kid to get a free, compulsory education,” Creswell said. “In most cases, you’re not really given an option to decline.”The Growing Influence of Ed TechThe need to scrutinize ed tech has exploded in recent years. In the school year before COVID-19 drove students out of classrooms and onto their devices, U.S. schools spent as much as $41 billion on educational technology, according to conservative estimates.\
During the years that followed, the federal government appropriated an unprecedented $263 billion in emergency-aid funding for schools, who used much of it to purchase the technology necessary for remote learning. In response to the demand, global venture capital investment in ed tech companies tripled from $7 billion in 2019 to $21 billion in 2021 (before dropping to a more modest $11 billion last year).\
Educators are clearly still cobbling together the resources they need to help ensure this is money well spent. They don’t have all the answers.

Prices are in USD. Pre-ordering is the only way to get one - they will not be sold in stores. Pre-order today at store.rePebble.com!Why are we making new Pebble-like smartwatches?Pretty simple - because we want one! No company has made a perfect smartwatch for people like us, so we’re going to make the exact smartwatch we want. Read the full story on my blog, but it comes down to 5 key features:Simple and beautiful designNo smartwatch on the market since Pebble offers this combination of features…until today!I think you might recognize this one 😉 It’s almost exactly a Pebble 2, upgraded with modern chips and new tricks. Duo is short for ‘Do-over’.Similar to Pebble 2, it featuresUltra crisp 1.26” black and white e-paper displayRuns 10,000+ Pebble apps and watchfacesLightweight polycarbonate frame in two colour options - White or BlackWater resistant (targeting IPX8)30 day battery life (up from 7)Linear resonance actuator (quieter and stronger than vibrating motor)More reliable buttons (up to 30% longer lifetime in testing)Barometer and compass sensorsSince this watch will look and feel just like a Pebble 2, you can refamiliarize yourself with it via videos, or reviews. For people interested in hacking on PebbleOS firmware, we’re offering an optional JTAG connector. I recommend buying 2 units if you want to hack, just in case!This is my dream watch. It’s everything Pebble Time 2 was going to be and more! 64-colour 1.5” e-paper display. Same display as Pebble Time 2 - much more room for text and details (53% bigger and 88% more pixels)Runs 10,000+ Pebble apps and watchfacesMetal frame and buttons (Black/White and likely a 3rd colour option as well)30 day battery life (estimate)Flat glass lens (less glare and reflections than Pebble Time family curved lens)Water resistant (targeting IPX8)Linear resonance actuator (vibrator)Standard 22mm watch strapThe industrial design is closely based on Pebble 2, which I really love. It’s slightly bigger to accommodate the larger display. Both the frame and buttons are made of metal (most likely CNC milled aluminum). More details, including final colour options, will be shared later this year. Left: Core 2 Duo - Right: Core Time 26-axis IMU, compass, barometerLinear resonance actuator (vibrator)Heart rate, step and sleep trackingEach watch runs open source PebbleOS. This enables all the baseline Pebble features like receiving notifications, timeline, watchfaces, alarms, timers, calendar, music control, basic fitness tracking, etc. The really fun part is that most of the existing 10,000+ PebbleOS watchfaces and apps will immediately work on these new watches, though some may try to access web services that no longer exist. Browse the full appstore on apps.rebble.io.Existing apps/faces will show up with a border on Core Time 2 until developers update them, since it has a larger display (200x228 vs 144x168 pixels). Read more about on the old Pebble dev blog.We will publish a companion mobile app for Android and iOS. My friend and past Pebble colleague, Steve, recently joined us to lead this effort. He’s joining crc32, long-time Cobble developer, who has been working with me since last summer. We’ll also be working on an updated SDK for creating new PebbleOS watchfaces or apps.These watches will be sold exclusively through store.rePebble.com. Due to limited supply of display inventory, both watches will be manufactured in limited quantities. I highly recommend placing a pre-order - we will be manufacturing fewer watches than the number of people who have signed up on rePebble already! A pre-order secures your watch but gives you flexibility if you change your mind - you can get a refund at any time up until your watch ships. Left: Core 2 Duo running PebbleOS - Right: Engineering samplesSchedule-wise,  is quite far along. We’ve already produced dozens of Core 2 Duo watches for testing and development. We’ve tested and confirmed our button improvements. PebbleOS has been compiled for the new architecture and runs on the watch. All firmware development is open source - you can follow the fun on Github and Discord. Our current schedule calls for shipments to begin in July. How are we so far along, given that PebbleOS was only open-sourced in January? Two things helped: a) I took a monetary risk and began product development a bit earlier 😉, and b) we found a supplier who still had inventory of some Pebble 2 components. Core Time 2 display lighting up! For , we’ve finished component selection, initial industrial and mechanical design, and found sources for long lead time components. Now, we’re in the middle of creating the first prototypes. The grand irony of hardware development is that software development is usually the slowest part of the project. Not this time! We’re extraordinarily thankful to Google for open sourcing PebbleOS, which gave us a massive boost.We’ll share more details (like Core Time 2 frame colour options) later this year, as we get closer to mass production. Our current schedule shows shipments beginning in December. Follow along on this blog, via email, on Bluesky or Twitter.Why were these specific specifications selected?Building a smartwatch is an exhausting (😂) exercise of constraint maximization. Think of it as linear algebra - we’re solving multiple equations with multiple unknown variables. The primary constraint is display selection. This choice governs the size and shape of the physical design, as well as being the component with the most power drain and biggest cost. Other variables are Bluetooth chip (governs: cost, software compatibility, engineering time), factory selection (cost, quality, speed, risk), sensors (power, cost, software), battery (size, battery life, cost) and more!Despite what Pebble’s second Kickstarter branding proclaimed, solving this inherently requires compromise. It’s a fine line to walk and generally the data is not 100% known upfront, so it inevitably requires some degree of trusting your gut. : we’re adding a touchscreen to Core Time 2. Why? Very specifically, I want to add the concept of ‘complications’ to watchfaces and widgets. Like on Apple Watch, these complications/widgets will show glanceable information like weather, next calendar event, step count, etc. The touch screen adds the ability to tap on the complication and directly open the associated app. This is much faster to use than opening an app via the button menu, and saves your quick launch (long-press on the buttons) for other apps. The touchscreen may be used for other interactions, like swiping to rapidly scroll down a list, but that will be lower priority. Core Time 2 will be the first PebbleOS watch to ship with a touchscreen, but not the first that we designed! In 2015, Pebble designed it into a watch called Cutts (or C2) and did some (very) preliminary software development work to integrate a touchscreen into PebbleOS.: I’m really excited that battery life will be increased from 7 days to 1 month! This is due to massive improvements in Bluetooth chip power efficiency over the last 10 years. : we’re adding this primarily for potential use in apps that benefit from audio output, like a ChatGPT or other AI agent app. It can’t easily be used for making voice calls, since the watches will not support Bluetooth Classic (required for headset profiles), but theoretically someone could write a custom voice calling client (eg SIP or something).: neither watch will support smartstraps. Sorry. Most people don’t even remember this feature even existed, which is kinda the answer to why it will not be supported. RIP.You shouldn’t get one if…You need a perfectly polished smartwatch. This project is a labour of love rather than a startup trying to sell millions of watches. There may be some rough edges (literally). Things will get delayed. Some features will not be ready at launch. Things could break. Things could not last as long as you’d like. The only thing we can guarantee is that it will be awesome and a lot of fun! Every time you look down at your watch, you will smile 🙂You’re looking for a fitness or sports watch. That’s not what we’re making. From what we hear, Garmin watches are great for runners/cyclists/triathletes!   You’re comparing this to an Apple Watch. There is NO way for a 3rd party smartwatch to compete with Apple Watch. Apple restricts 3rd parties in major ways - read my blog post for more information. For example, 3rd party watches on iOS cannot send replies to notifications.   These watches are not made for everyone. We want to be upfront with you about what to expect. Watch images above feature impeccably designed watchfaces from TTMM, including one of my all-time favourites - TTMMBRN. Thank you Albert!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Firefox: Mozilla is working on Progressive Web Apps (PWA) support</title><link>https://www.ghacks.net/2025/03/17/firefox-mozilla-is-working-on-progressive-web-apps-pwa-support/</link><author>/u/B3_Kind_R3wind_</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 11:08:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Apartment building attacked by Ukrainian drone in Russia’s Rostov on Don</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDYKgiysgVw</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/TDYKgiysgVw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 10:53:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Local authorities said two people were injured and there was damage to six apartments and the building facade.

 Sure, some companies are hauling workloads back to on-prem servers, but the cloud security market’s not sweating it — it’s set to hit $156.25 billion by 2032 (Fortune Business Insights). Hybrid and multi-cloud setups are the new norm, not a cloud exodus, and emerging threats like quantum computing keep the demand for pros like you sky-high. The future’s a wild mashup of cloud, on-prem, and quantum-ready defenses — so buckle up, you’re still golden.\
You’ve seen the headlines screaming: “Businesses are ditching the cloud faster than you can say ‘AWS outage’!” It’s the kind of news that could make a cloud security pro spill their coffee, mutter “Is my job toast?” and eye the server room exit — only to realize it’s still humming with cloud action.\
Before you trade your CNAPP expertise for a dusty on-prem manual, let’s cut through the noise. The cloud security market isn’t shrinking — it’s growing like your inbox after a week off, and the data backs it up. So, grab your caffeine fix, and let’s unpack this “cloud repatriation” drama — because spoiler alert: it’s not the endgame you think.Cloud Repatriation: Less Apocalypse, More Remix\
Hold your horses. Most of these companies aren’t torching their cloud subscriptions and swearing off Azure like it’s a bad Tinder date. They’re juggling a  — part cloud, part on-prem — or hopping between providers in a multi-cloud acrobatics show. Think of it like pulling a few vinyls off Spotify to spin on your turntable. You’re not canceling streaming — you’re just vibing with both.\
Here’s the kicker: hybrid setups still need cloud security for the bits that stay sky-high. More clouds mean more chaos, and that’s where you swoop in with your cape of expertise. The cloud’s not dead — it’s just getting a funky remix.Why Are They Repatriating? (Hint: It’s Not Always Your Fault)So, why are companies dragging workloads back on-prem? Let’s break it down — and no, it’s not all about security nightmares: Cloud bills can hit you like a ninja in the dark — data egress fees, scaling costs, and surprise charges add up. Sometimes on-prem feels like a budget-friendly hug. Certain apps demand the spotlight of local servers to shine — think latency-sensitive workloads that scoff at cloud lag. Regulated industries (hello, finance and healthcare) love on-site servers for that warm, fuzzy feeling of keeping data under their thumb.\
 even when workloads come home, most companies keep one foot in the cloud. Hybrid means double doors to lock, and multi-cloud’s a whack-a-mole marathon across platforms. Bad news for lazy weekends, great news for your job security. You’re the ringmaster keeping this tech circus safe.Cloud Security Market: Growing Like a Bad Wi-Fi SignalIf repatriation were the cloud security grim reaper, the market would be flatlining. Instead, it’s throwing a rager:\
What’s fueling this? ’s insatiable appetite, hybrid sprawl, and multi-cloud madness are pumping demand for tools like CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platforms) and ASPM (Application Security Posture Management). These are your security Swiss Army knives — slashing vulnerabilities, nailing compliance, and keeping the chaos at bay. The market’s not shrinking — it’s flexing harder than a bodybuilder on TikTok.From CSPM to CNAPP: The Glow-Up You Didn’t Know You NeededCloud security’s evolved faster than a Pokémon on a candy binge. Remember  (Cloud Security Posture Management)? It was the OG, sniffing out misconfigs and compliance hiccups — solid, but siloed.\
Then came , the all-in-one superhero:Infrastructure lockdown and compliance checks.Workload protection (CWPP vibes).Identity and access management.Container and Kubernetes kung-fu.App security testing on steroids.\
CNAPP’s Secret Sauce: Ever drowned in a sea of alerts? CNAPP’s got your back with AI and ML wizardry:Prioritizes threats by “is this actually bad?” impact.Correlates signals for big-picture clarity.Suggests fixes so you’re not playing guess-the-patch.Cuts false positives like a ninja with a katana.\
This isn’t just a tool — it’s your new best friend in the hybrid jungle. CSPM was the appetizer; CNAPP’s the full buffet.The Future: Hybrid Chaos, Quantum Twists, and YouThe IT future isn’t cloud-or-bust or on-prem-or-nothing — it’s a hybrid-multi-cloud mashup. Securing it? Think herding cats across AWS, Azure, and that dusty server rack in the basement. Each platform’s a diva with its own quirks, and you’re the maestro keeping the symphony tight.\
Your toolkit’s leveling up: CNAPP guards cloud apps, ASPM watches app lifecycles, and DSPM (Data Security Posture Management) babysits sensitive data. Oh, and “Shift-Left”? Not a dance move — it’s catching bugs early in dev, saving you from late-night firefights.Now, the wild card: Post-Quantum Cryptography. It’s a plot twist so trippy, Christopher Nolan’s scribbling notes in a quantum maze. Quantum computers could crack today’s encryption like a walnut, and bad guys are already hoarding data for the big reveal. NIST’s new standards (NIST) are your shield, but the clock’s ticking. No PhD needed — just a heads-up to quantum-proof your game.\
This future’s a cocktail of cloud sprawl, on-prem quirks, and quantum spice. AI’s your co-pilot, but you’re the captain — your human smarts keep it all from crashing. The cloud security gig? Still hotter than a server on overdrive.Key Takeaways: Your Survival Guide to Cloud Security GloryRepatriation’s not kryptonite — it’s a hybrid remix, not a cloud killer.Market’s flexing, hitting $156.25 billion by 2032 — plenty of room for you.Hybrid and multi-cloud reign, fueling CNAPP, ASPM, and DSPM love.It’s not just security — cost, performance, and compliance nudge the on-prem shift.Quantum’s your next boss fight — grab your post-quantum decoder ring and prep.:::info

The two leaders met for surprise talks in Qatar, just hours after negotiations in Angola failed.
Rwanda's Paul Kagame and DRC President Felix Tshisekedi met with Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. In a statement the two heads of state "reaffirmed the commitment of all parties to an immediate and unconditional ceasefire."
The Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group had earlier pulled out of peace talks with the DRC that were scheduled in Angola on Tuesday. The group blamed EU sanctions on some of its members. So what's at stake in eastern DRC?
M23 escalated its offensive in January, seizing control of the strategic cities of Goma and Bukavu in the mineral-rich areas, near the border with Rwanda. Analysts say M23 is no longer just a military actor, but presenting itself as a political force.
The conflict has killed thousands of civilians and displaced many more, leading to a humanitarian crisis. The recent fighting raised fears of a repeat of the Second Congo War, from 1998 to 2003, which involved numerous African countries and caused millions of deaths from violence, disease and starvation.
Just last week a Southern African regional force said it was ending its troop deployment in DRC. At least 17 soldiers from the mission habe been killed in the east of the country since January. 
SADC, the 16-nation bloc, held a virtual summit to discuss the ongoing conflict in an area that has seen three decades of unrest. The troops were deployed there two years ago to support the Congolese army against M23.
And the government of the DRC has also been looking to the US for a potential deal that would see the US invest in critical minerals while helping to reinforce stability. 
DRC President Felix Tshisekedi met US lawmaker Ronny Jackson to discuss fighting in the east of the country and opportunities for US investment. Earlier Washington said it was open to exploring critical minerals partnerships with Congo.

Martial law imposed in Ukraine at the outset of Russia’s full-scale invasion prohibits the country from holding elections.The Dutch community page that called on people to participate in the protest claimed the event was “coordinated by Ukrainian refugees.” Strangely enough, it appears there were no Ukrainians at the gathering.Of the eight demonstrators who showed up in Amsterdam, five were Dutch and two were Russian. The identity of one remains unverified by the Kyiv Independent.Without attracting much attention on the streets, participants quietly unfolded their placards bearing blunt and provocative messages: “Ukraine is evil for Dutch taxpayers” and “Zelensky! Stop killing your people!” Another read “Sponsoring Kiev is sponsoring terrorism against Ukrainians,” using the Russian spelling for Ukraine’s capital city Kyiv. No Ukrainian flags were seen at the protest, despite the organizers’ claim that Ukrainians had coordinated the event. The only country flag present was Russian, with the words “Peace with Russia” written on it.Protesters took turns posing with different posters. The messages on the posters warned of war between NATO and Russia, calling for a Ukraine without Zelensky, blaming Zelensky for Russia’s full-scale invasion, and demanding the end of “forced mobilization” in Ukraine.While a small event, the gathering was part of a larger anti-Ukraine movement posing as a peace initiative that has been ongoing for over two years.Network of Dutch RussiansAfter the onset of Russia’s full-scale invasion, a group of Dutch activists took to the streets in response to what they perceived as the establishment and media inciting warmongering and hatred toward Russia. Since February 2023, the group, which operates under the name “Vredesdemonstratie” meaning “Peace Demonstration” in Dutch, has been holding monthly protests. At these events, demonstrators advocate for ending military aid for Ukraine — who they blame for the war along with NATO — and making peace with Russia. Their banners usually feature phrases such as “No weapons for peace” or “Peace with Russia” in both Dutch and English. The foreign military aid, including assistance from the Netherlands, which the group so passionately opposes, has been critical to Ukraine’s ability to defend itself from Russia’s invasion. Among individual countries, the Netherlands ranks fifth in total military aid, contributing 5.88 billion euros between Jan. 24, 2022, and Dec. 31, 2024, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, which tracks aid to Ukraine. Although they present themselves as a movement of “pacifist idealists,” members of Peace Demonstration make their demands solely of Ukraine and its supporters, and never of Russia.The reason for this approach becomes clear as soon as one looks at the composition of the participants: many of the most active protesters at these rallies are Dutch Russians — migrants of Russian origin who settled in the Netherlands long ago. Some have lived in the Netherlands for over 20 years. The group’s demonstrations often feature Russian flags and sometimes include cultural performances, such as singing traditional songs, dancing, and wearing traditional attire.Despite their clear ties to Russian culture, the protesters never identify as being members of the Russian diaspora. It appears that they purposefully keep the origin of the protests blurry, trying to pass the events as Dutch or Ukrainian. Among those posing with a Russian flag in a recent photo-op protest was Natalia Vorontsova, also known as Nata Heezen. As a co-organizer, she is a key figure in nearly every Peace Demonstration event.Originally from Russia’s southwestern city of Voronezh, Vorontsova has lived in the Netherlands for over 20 years. She works as a nurse in mental health care.Alongside fellow activists Nikita Ananjev and Elena Plotnikova, she has been lobbying for Russian interests in the Netherlands since 2014, the year when Russia invaded Ukraine’s Crimea and the eastern part of Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.Campaigning in the NetherlandsIn 2016, Vorontsova joined a campaign organized by the Dutch Socialist Party that brought together a group of Russians and Ukrainians with pro-Russian views to advocate against Ukraine’s European integration in a Dutch referendum.Despite a low turnout of 32.2%, Dutch voters rejected the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement. The vote was non-binding and did not overturn the agreement, which had already been ratified by the other 27 EU member states.Alongside Vorontsova, two other prominent campaigners were Nikita Ananjev — a Russian who formerly chaired the Russian Student Association in the Netherlands — and Elena Plotnikova, who describes herself on X as a “Russian from Donetsk,” a Ukrainian city that has been under occupation since 2014. Three years later, in 2019, all three were involved in another organization — the Dutch branch of the Global Rights of Peaceful People (GRPP) international platform, which has advocated for Russian-controlled forces in eastern Ukraine. Ananjev is introduced in one of the platform’s videos as the president of the Dutch Committee of GRPP, while Plotnikova managed the organization’s email correspondence. The GRPP is deregistered from the Dutch Chamber of Commerce. It is not known why its registration was canceled. GRPP organized a press conference aimed at discrediting an official investigation conducted by the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) into the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 in eastern Ukraine. According to the JIT’s conclusions, Russia's military delivered a Buk missile fired by Russian-controlled militants in July 2014, killing all 298 people on board, including 196 Dutch citizens.At the press conference, where Vorontsova served as host, a documentary by a former Russia Today journalist Yana Yerlashova and a Dutch blogger Max van der Werff was presented. The film seeks to discredit the official MH17 investigation and deny Russia’s responsibility for the plane’s downing.The film’s creators are best known for their involvement with Bonanza Media, a project widely regarded as part of the Kremlin’s disinformation efforts. A joint investigation by Bellingcat and The Insider revealed evidence that Bonanza Media coordinated with Russia’s military intelligence service (known by its Russian acronym GRU) to downplay Russia’s involvement in the MH17 downing. Investigators also discovered that Plotnikova was involved with Bonanza Media.Today, it appears, Vorontsova’s main focus is solely on co-organizing Peace Demonstration events in the Netherlands where she’s one of the key faces and voices heard.She maintains close ties with Russian state media, including TASS and RIA Novosti, whose correspondents often attend the demonstrations and interview Vorontsova for their articles. The published materials are later reshared by Vorontsova in the online groups for protest participants. While their demonstrations attract little attention from the Dutch media, they receive extensive coverage in Russia, making them seem like a large-scale movement.Meanwhile, Plotnikova remains active primarily on social media and within the Peace Demonstration community. In 2023, she delivered a speech at one of the demonstrations.Embracing conspiratorial narratives about “NATO missiles killing civilians,” Vorontsova’s demonstrations attract individuals from both far-left and far-right populist circles, united by their pro-Russian sentiment. The pool of guest speakers ranges from communists in anti-fascist movements to MPs from the Dutch far-right party Forum for Democracy (FvD).An investigation by the Dutch newspaper NRC found that Vorontsova may have received funding for her activities from Volunteers of Victory — a Russian government-funded organization that glorifies Russian military patriotism during World War II and supports Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine. Despite Volunteers of Victory being sanctioned by the EU, its Dutch branch Victory Team 75 Netherlands remains active by operating unofficially and avoiding formal registration.In a conversation with the Kyiv Independent, Vorontsova denied any involvement with the Dutch branch of Volunteers of Victory, stating that she had only worn a cap with the organization’s logo that she received as a gift, but had no connection to the group. She also emphasized that she is an independent activist, acts on her own, and is not financially supported by anyone. According to Vorontsova, she finances the demonstrations with donations from supporters.Another participant of the February photo shoot in Amsterdam, Iolanta DuCroix, also known as Klimaite Bardash, appears in several photos on the Instagram page of the local branch of Volunteers of Victory. A Russian-born resident of the Netherlands, DuCroix assisted Vorontsova in holding a Russian flag during the photo shoot.Another participant, Nikita Ananjev, is also a prominent figure in the Russian Volunteers of Victory movement. Known as a coordinator of the Dutch branch, he seems to be present at nearly every one of the organization’s events. He was also a representative of the Coordination Council of Russian Compatriots in the Netherlands, an organization that works closely with the Russian embassy.After Russia’s full-scale invasion, Ananjev openly expressed pro-Putin views. On his page on Vkontakte — a Russian social media platform — he reposted an image stating: "Kyiv will either be Russian or deserted. And we're fine with it being deserted too."When asked about her cooperation with Ananjev, given his active involvement with organizations affiliated with Russia, Vorontsova told the Kyiv Independent that she has not seen Ananjev in years nor collaborated with him on any activities since they were both part of the Dutch branch of the International Platform Global Rights of Peaceful People (GRPP).A Ukrainian defector and a Soviet-era emigrantAlthough Peace Demonstration’s messaging appears to reflect Russian interests, its members claim that Ukrainians are also among their representatives.After analyzing dozens of participants in the group’s demonstrations, the Kyiv Independent found only one Ukrainian who actually spoke in person at their protests. The group’s website and social media present the supposed Ukrainian representative as “Elena from Kiev,” using the Russian spelling for both her name and Ukraine’s capital. In reality, “Elena from Kiev” has not lived in Ukraine since the 1990s, having spent several years in Afghanistan before settling in the Netherlands, according to an interview she gave to AlternatiefTV in August 2023. Her experience of Ukraine is limited to the Soviet era. Like other participants in the rallies, Elena’s views, as she expressed them in the interview with Alternatief TV, align with a line of Kremlin propaganda that insists Ukrainians and Russians are "the same people.” This view is widely rejected in Ukraine. A 2022 poll found that 91% of Ukrainians do not consider Russia and Ukraine to be “one people.”Two other Ukrainians appeared at the demonstrations via video message, supposedly from Russia. One of them, Dmitry Vasilets, is a pro-Kremlin propaganda blogger. In 2024, he was sentenced in absentia by a Ukrainian court to five years in prison for justifying Russia's aggression against Ukraine, as well as advocating for a violent overthrow of the government.Vasilet’s criminal record dates back to 2017 when he was convicted of facilitating the broadcast of a Russian propaganda channel in Russian-occupied parts of eastern Ukraine. He spent two years in a pre-trial detention center in Ukraine.According to Ukrainian law enforcement, eleven days before Russia's full-scale invasion, he fled Ukraine for Egypt and later settled in Moscow, where he declared himself the secretary of the so-called “Representative Office of the Ukrainian People” — a body not recognized by Ukraine.At Vorontsova’s demonstrations, Vasilets appears on the LED screen, calling himself a leader of the Ukrainian party Derzhava in exile. However, Derzhava was banned in Ukraine in 2022 due to its ties to Russia and was so unpopular that it never gained parliamentary representation. During its only attempt to get into parliament in 2006 as part of the "State-Labor Union" bloc, it earned just 0.14% of the vote.Moreover, the Peace Demonstration group also claimed to have Ukrainian independent press at one of their press conferences but did not specify which outlet. The Kyiv Independent found only one non-Dutch media platform covering the event — Vasilets’ pro-Russian Telegram channel, Mriya. The biography of the second Ukrainian, who participated virtually in events organized by Peace Demonstrations in the Netherlands, is no less vivid and far from Ukraine.Judging by the social media posts of Peace Demonstration the international pro-Russian photo shoots appear to be coordinated by another Moscow-based organization, the Union of Political Emigrants and Political Prisoners of Ukraine.Its spokesperson, Leonid Ilderkin, is mentioned in posts related to a previous international pro-Russian campaign that features almost identical scripted messages promoting anti-NATO and anti-Zelensky messages.Ilderkin appeared in a video message for Peace Demonstrations as a so-called “Ukrainian opposition figure in exile.” In the video, he blames the U.S. and Europe for Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.A native of Dnipro, Ukraine, Ilderkin was previously an activist in the pro-Russian communist organization Borotba, meaning “struggle” in Ukrainian. When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, Borotba members supported the occupation of eastern Ukraine, with some even taking up arms on the Russian side. After fleeing Ukraine that same year, the group now operates from Russia and recently participated in an event titled the International Anti-fascist Forum in Russian-occupied Luhansk Oblast. According to documents obtained by the independent Russian anti-corruption project Dossier Center, Russia's military intelligence agency (known by its Russian acronym GRU) attempted to use organizations linked to Ilderkin to coordinate with the European radical left and recruit individuals for protests and acts of sabotage. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify this information.The Union of Political Emigrants and Political Prisoners of Ukraine, which has been given a platform by Dutch demonstrations, consists of pro-Russian fugitives.Among them is Mykola Azarov, Ukraine’s former prime minister under Kremlin-backed President Viktor Yanukovych, who was ousted following the EuroMaidan Revolution in 2014. Azarov participated in a meeting organized by the Union of Political Emigrants in late 2016.Russian demonstration network in EuropeAlthough the Union of Political Emigrants and Political Prisoners of Ukraine has little media presence and minimal influence on social media, it supports other pro-Russian demonstrations beyond the Netherlands.For instance, a so-called “Ukrainian political prisoner” from the union addressed pro-Russian demonstrators in the U.K. online from Moscow in August 2024. The “political prisoner” in the video address is the Union’s chairwoman, Larisa Shesler. She is wanted by Ukrainian law enforcement for “undermining Ukraine’s territorial integrity.”  Shesler, a Ukrainian, played a key role in undermining pro-European protests in the Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv in 2013-2014. She coordinated the local anti-protest movement and organized pro-Russian rallies before eventually fleeing to Russia.The Kyiv Independent found out and verified that she had obtained Russian citizenship.Shesler’s video message to the British pro-Russian demonstrations was picked up and promoted by Theo Russell from the U.K.-based International Ukraine Anti-Fascist Solidarity movement. Russell, a British activist, is also involved in the Dutch organization Peace Demonstration, having spoken at events and frequently posted in community groups.Meanwhile, the YouTube channel Chega Serna English, which has been sharing videos of “Ukrainian political prisoners,” posts footage from pro-Russian rallies in cities like Washington, D.C., Sacramento, Paris, and notably Amsterdam. The footage reveals a recurring pattern — consistent messaging, tone, and symbols, including Soviet and Russian flags. A unifying theme runs through these rallies: a push to end military aid to Ukraine, a critical lifeline for its defense. This mirrors what was seen in Amsterdam.Russian influence in Europe remains strong, backed by a vast network of pro-Kremlin actors, some of whom are hiding behind Ukrainian names.Hi, I’m Linda Hourani, the author of this story.

“I can’t guarantee anything,” Bessent said in an interview Tuesday with Fox Business’ Maria Bartiromo, dismissing any question about assuring there won’t be one as “silly.”

Economists have warned there’s rising risk of an economic downturn thanks in part to uncertainty over President Donald Trump’s tariff hikes, and to worries over their impact once the levies are decided on and implemented.

Campbell Harvey, professor of finance at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business, explains how the Trump-led trade war will likely manifest itself in markets and in US policy going forward. Professor Harvey speaks with Tom Keene and Paul Sweeney on Bloomberg Radio.

In this post, I will only discuss what happens when you delete  on Linux and how to recover from that.The easy solution for everything is to replace the missing files, but this can be difficult if  is deleted because we won’t have , which is needed to run any dynamic executable. When you deleted , all non-static executable (such as , , , will output): No such file or directory
You will also be unable to open any new connection using ssh, or open a new tmux window/pane if you are using tmux. So you can only rely on your current shell built in, and some static executables that you have on the system.If you have a static  installed, then it can be your rescue. You can use  from  to download libraries from a clean system.  For your information: Debian has  installed by default, but the default is not the static version.If you are worried that this kind of problem might happen to you in the future: Install the static version of the busybox binary, and confirm that it is the correct version.I assume right now that you don’t have a static busybox, and you don’t even have any static executables (which is the situation in many cases, like in the default install of minimal Debian). My solution for this is to download a static busybox from another machine. I also assume that you have bash installed (which is the default for most systems).  Bash has a lot of default built-ins that we can use.  There is a solution from here that can be used to download a file using only built-in bash functions. Other solutions on this thread rely on external command (such as ).  Please note that you need to set the environment  variable  to ; Otherwise, this script will incorrectly handle Unicode bytes.Of course, we can’t  the destination file to be executable, so we need to overwrite an existing executable. If you have busybox installed (even if it is the non-static version), you can overwrite this file. At this point, you can start the rescue mission: for example, use  to download fresh  from another system.Please note that busybox can’t function with a name that is not a busybox applet name. So if you overwrite for example, the  binary with , then it won’t work (it will say: ).  If you don’t have , I suggest overwriting , then you can use  to create a copy of  as  (which will be executable).If you have a more advanced shell (e.g: zsh), it has TCP modules already built in. You can easily use  from another machine to send a file to the target machine. Now, let’s assume that you have a very basic shell, for example: . Most shell  (including dash), has  as built-in, and we can use this to construct binary files. Most (all?) shell’s built-in   implementation supports  where  is 3 digit octal. First approach is to just convert , but this file is quite big (2 megabyte). Copy-pasting  large  commands is tedious and is error-prone. We need a small static binary that can help us.This  trick will also work for other OS, if you can create a small binary for that OS.Creating a small ELF for LinuxYou can create a very tiny executable if you use assembly directly, but let’s try to do this using C, so it can be portable across different architectures. The smallest useful program that I can think of is just to copy from stdin to stdout, so we can prepare  on a machine:cat busybox | nc -v -l -p 10000and then we can do this from the borked machine:The source code can be like this:#include "unistd.h"

int main()
{
        char x;
        while (1) {
                int c = read(0, &x, 1);
                if (c!=0) break;
                c = write(1, &x, 1);
                if (c!=0) break;
        }
        return 0;
}
If we try to compile this with standard C library (on AMD64 machine), the result is 776KB. gcc -Os -Wl,--build-id=none -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables -fno-ident -s -nostdlib -nodefaultlibs -static -include nolibc.h fd.c -lgcc -o fdWe get a 4536 bytes binary. Quite good. If we add , we can even get a smaller size. gcc -Os -Wl,--build-id=none -z max-page-size=0x04 -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables -fno-ident -s -nostdlib -nodefaultlibs -static -include nolibc.h fd.c -lgcc -o fdIt is now 672 bytes. Small enough to transfer. We can convert this using Python.import sys

with open(sys.argv[1], "rb") as f:
    data = f.read()

start = 0
width = 20
targetname = sys.argv[2]
while True:
    part = data[start:start+width]
    if part=='':
        break
    a = ''.join(['\\'+(oct(ord(i)).zfill(3))[-3:] for i in part])
    dest = '>'
    if start>0:
        dest += '>'
    dest += ' ' + targetname
    print("printf '{}' {} ".format(a, dest))
    start += width

We can then copy paste this to our ssh session, then do the  redirection trick.Of course, we can also write a complete program that makes the TCP connection instead of relying on bash redirection.I hope you will never need this knowledgeThis problem occurred to me a few days ago when I updated my Solar Powered Pi Zero, and somehow  got deleted (not sure what caused it). This is not a very important machine, and I could have just reimaged the MicroSD card and be done with it, but I was curious if I could recover from the error. I hope you will never have this error on your production/important machine, but if you have this problem in the future, I hope this post will help you recover from the situation.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Are Birthrates Plummeting Worldwide?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ispyUPqqL1c</link><author>Patrick Boyle</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ispyUPqqL1c?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 07:15:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw">Patrick Boyle</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Go to https://ground.news/pb to get up to 40% off unlimited access to stay fully informed.

Birth rates are plummeting worldwide – and while this might seem like nothing new – as it has been the case in developed countries for quite some time. The thing that is interesting is that we are seeing declining birth rates everywhere and the standard explanations that you have heard in the past don’t really hold up.

The explosion at a Hayes substation 1.5 miles from the airport knocked out power early Thursday, requiring 70 firefighters to battle a blaze in a transformer containing 25,000 liters of cooling oil. 

Despite backup generators, Europe's busiest airport couldn't maintain normal operations, forcing flights to divert to airports across Europe and as far as Bangor, Maine. "Contingencies of certain sizes we cannot guard ourselves against 100%," Heathrow CEO Thomas Woldbye told the BBC. "This is as big as it gets for our airport." British Airways, which planned to carry 100,000 passengers Friday, prioritized long-haul flights to Australia, Brazil and South Africa when operations resumed after 4 p.m.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>This Week in Plasma: 6.4 Improvements</title><link>https://blogs.kde.org/2025/03/22/this-week-in-plasma-6.4-improvements/</link><author>/u/gabriel_3</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 06:41:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome to a new issue of "This Week in Plasma"! Every week we cover the highlights of what's happening in the world of KDE Plasma and its associated apps like Discover, System Monitor, and more.This week Plasma 6.4 continued to take shape, with a number of additional user-visible modernizations and improvements — in particular some nice progress on the topics of keyboard navigation, accessibility, and customizing apps' presentation in launcher menus.Added keyboard navigation and interaction to the User Switcher widget's popup. (Marco Martin, link)KMenuEdit has received a UI modernization, including a simplification of the default toolbar contents, showing a well-curated hamburger menu by default, and adopting modern-style tool view tabs. (Oliver Beard, link 1 and link 2)When installing apps in Discover, progress feedback now appears right in the place you were just looking, rather than in the opposite corner of the window. (Nate Graham, link)Plasma's Calculator widget now announces the calculated result using the screen reader, if one is active. (Christoph Wolk, link)Improved keyboard navigation for Plasma's Calculator widget; now navigation wraps around on the same row or column. (Christoph Wolk, link)In System Monitor's table views, you can now press + to select everything, as you would expect. (Arjen Hiemstra, link)After editing a page in System Monitor, the app now scrolls to show a newly-added row if it would otherwise appear out of the visible area. (Arjen Hiemstra, link)KWin's "Dim Screen for Administrator Mode" plugin is now on by default, helping to focus attention on authentication prompts so you're less likely to miss them or lose them, especially with a cluttered desktop full of stuff. (Vlad Zahorodnii, link)OSDs are now consistently referred to as "OSDs" in all the places you can disable them. (Nate Graham, link 1 and link 2)System Monitor now displays something more user-friendly when asked to report the battery charge level of a device whose battery technology it can't determine. (David Redondo, link)Narrowed the range of data that the Plasma clipboard accepts to be more in line with what it did in Plasma 6.2 and earlier. This prevents Plasma form crashing when copying certain types of content in certain apps. (Fushan Wen, link)Triggering the system bell a zillion times in rapid succession (e.g. by holding down  in an XWayland-using GTK app; don't do that) no longer freezes the entire system. (Nicolas Fella, link)Fixed a bug in the Weather Report widget that caused it to fail to save its settings (size, position, even its existence) under certain circumstances when placed on the desktop, rather than a panel. (Marco Martin, link)The User Switcher widget now lays out text for the username more sensibly, neither getting too big with huge horizontal panels, nor overflowing with not-huge vertical panels. (Marco Martin and Nate Graham, link 1 and link 2)Fixed a regression in the new spatial quick tiling code that made global actions to instantly quarter-tile the active window not always work correctly the first time they were invoked. (Vlad Zahorodnii, link)Fixed a regression that broke pasting numbers into Plasma's Calculator widget. (Christoph Wolk, link)Fixed a regression that caused the icons of Folder View popups in list mode to be displayed with too much transparency. (Nate Graham, link)Fixed a bug that caused KMenuEdit to be unable to save changes you made to systemwide-installed Flatpak apps that had previously been customized using the properties dialog. (Oliver Beard, link)Fixed several minor issues affecting the Media Frame widget, including flickering on image change and not remembering customized popup sizes when living in a panel. (Marco Martin, link)Non-full-screen screen recordings taken in Spectacle now have significantly higher visual quality when using a fractional screen scale factor. (Vlad Zahorodnii and Noah Davis, link 1, link 2, link 3, link 4, link 5)KDE has become important in the world, and your time and contributions have helped us get there.

The system lures crawlers into a "maze" of AI-generated pages containing neutral scientific information, deliberately wasting computing resources of those attempting to collect training data for language models without permission. 

"When we detect unauthorized crawling, rather than blocking the request, we will link to a series of AI-generated pages that are convincing enough to entice a crawler to traverse them," Cloudflare explained. The company reports AI crawlers generate over 50 billion requests to their network daily, comprising nearly 1% of all web traffic they process. The feature is available to all Cloudflare customers, including those on free plans. This approach marks a shift from traditional protection methods, as Cloudflare claims blocking bots sometimes alerts operators they've been detected. The false links contain meta directives to prevent search engine indexing while remaining attractive to data-scraping bots.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ukraine not only gets military aid from its supporters, but produces its own weapons, too | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k_LsS4SF4Q</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/3k_LsS4SF4Q?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 04:01:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ongoing US military support for Ukraine looks anything but certain — even as Russia continues to attack its critical infrastructure with drones and cruise missiles. The Ukrainian military has been able to turn to Germany for additional air defense systems — one of them called the "IRIS-T". 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced that his country has successfully deployed a long-range guided cruise missile. That would expand its ability to strike deep into Russia. 
The so-called Long Neptune is a version of the anti-ship Neptune. Zelenskyy claims the Long Neptune can reach targets up to 1,000 kilometers away.

"The way to get ahead at Amazon is not to go accumulate a giant team and fiefdom," Jassy told employees, stressing that successful leaders "get the most done with the least amount of resources."

Rinsch, 47, was arrested in West Hollywood this week on charges of wire fraud, money laundering and unlawful monetary transactions that could result in decades of imprisonment if convicted. The FBI and Acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York allege Rinsch diverted funds meant for his series "Conquest" to speculate on cryptocurrency, stay in luxury hotels and purchase high-end items including five Rolls-Royces and a Ferrari. 

Netflix had paid Rinsch $44 million between 2018 and 2019 for the science fiction project about an artificial humanlike species. Prosecutors say he then requested an additional $11 million but never completed the production. An arbitrator ruled in Netflix's favor last year, ordering Rinsch to pay the company $11.8 million. Rinsch appeared in federal court with shackles and posted a $100,000 bond.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Prompts We Used in Our Experiments</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/the-prompts-we-used-in-our-experiments?source=rss</link><author>Transcompiler: Learn How to Translate Code</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 00:54:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[C Prompts Used in Our ExperimentsC.3 Prompt for NL PlanningC.4 Prompt for EXECUTE phaseC.5 Prompt for evaluating Direct PromptingC.6 Prompt for evaluating Zero-shot CoTC.7 Prompt for evaluating Zero-shot PoTC.8 Prompt for evaluating Plan-and-Solve(1) Hyungjoo Chae, Yonsei University;(2) Yeonghyeon Kim, Yonsei University;(3) Seungone Kim, KAIST AI;(4) Kai Tzu-iunn Ong, Yonsei University;(5) Beong-woo Kwak, Yonsei University;(6) Moohyeon Kim, Yonsei University;(7) Seonghwan Kim, Yonsei University;(8) Taeyoon Kwon, Yonsei University;(9) Jiwan Chung, Yonsei University;(10) Youngjae Yu, Yonsei University;(11) Jinyoung Yeo, Yonsei University.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Monster Cables picked the wrong guy to threaten (2008)</title><link>https://www.oncontracts.com/monster-cables-picked-the-wrong-guy-to-threaten/</link><author>wallflower</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 00:30:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[… Once I have received the above materials and explanations from you, I will undertake to analyze this information and let you know whether we are willing to accede to any of the demands made in your letter. If my analysis shows that there is any reasonable likelihood that we have infringed in any way any of Monster Cable’s intellectual property rights, we will of course take any and all action necessary to resolve the situation.  If I do not hear from you within the next fourteen days, or if I do hear from you but do not receive all of the information requested above, I will assume that you have abandoned these claims and closed your file. As for your requests for information, or for action, directed to me: I would remind you that it is you, not I, who are making claims; and it is you, not I, who must substantiate those claims.  You have not done so. I have seen Monster Cable take untenable IP positions in various different scenarios in the past, and am generally familiar with what seems to be Monster Cable’s modus operandi in these matters.  I therefore think that it is important that, before closing, I make you aware of a few points. After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1985, I spent nineteen years in litigation practice, with a focus upon federal litigation involving large damages and complex issues.  My first seven years were spent primarily on the defense side, where I developed an intense frustration with insurance carriers who would settle meritless claims for nuisance value when the better long-term view would have been to fight against vexatious litigation as a matter of principle. In plaintiffs’ practice, likewise, I was always a strong advocate of standing upon principle and taking cases all the way to judgment, even when substantial offers of settlement were on the table.  I am “uncompromising” in the most literal sense of the word.  If Monster Cable proceeds with litigation against me I will pursue the same merits-driven approach; I do not compromise with bullies and I would rather spend fifty thousand dollars on defense than give you a dollar of unmerited settlement funds. As for signing a licensing agreement for intellectual property which I have not infringed: that will not happen, under any circumstances, whether it makes economic sense or not. I say this because my observation has been that Monster Cable typically operates in a hit-and-run fashion.  Your client threatens litigation, expecting the victim to panic and plead for mercy; and what follows is a quickie negotiation session that ends with payment and a licensing agreement.  Your client then uses this collection of licensing agreements to convince others under similar threat to accede to its demands.  Let me be clear about this: there are only two ways for you to get anything out of me.  You will either need to (1) convince me that I have infringed, or (2) obtain a final judgment to that effect from a court of competent jurisdiction. It may be that my inability to see the pragmatic value of settling frivolous claims is a deep character flaw, and I am sure a few of the insurance carriers for whom I have done work have seen it that way; but it is how I have done business for the last quarter-century and you are not going to change my mind.  If you sue me, the case will go to judgment, and I will hold the court’s attention upon the merits of your claims–or, to speak more precisely, the absence of merit from your claims–from start to finish. Not only am I unintimidated by litigation; I sometimes rather miss it.I can relate to Denke’s final comment quoted above ….  I wonder what the attendant publicity is doing for his sales.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Looking for a Better Deal on Broadband? What You Should Be Doing to Find It</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/looking-for-a-better-deal-on-broadband-what-you-should-be-doing-to-find-it?source=rss</link><author>The Markup</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 00:07:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the first things I did upon moving into a new apartment last November was get a better deal on my broadband internet.To discover what other internet service providers (ISPs) offered service to my building, I used a handy resource that the Federal Communications Commission had just released to the public a few days earlier—a new version of the National Broadband Map. It’s an interactive tool that displays which companies offer connections at every location in the country and the maximum speed for those connections.\
When I entered my address into the map, I discovered that Astound, a provider I didn’t know about, could offer me the same speeds I was getting from Spectrum, which was already the internet provider for the apartment. A visit to Astound’s website revealed that the company could also give me a cheaper price, which ended up saving me around $27 a month.\
The National Broadband Map has gotten major updates twice each year for more than a decade with info about which companies provide internet service to a given area. However, until last year, the map only had details for a general area—not for individual addresses. This lack of granularity presented a problem because, as an investigation into the digital divide by The Markup showed, the maximum speed offered by just one provider can vary dramatically from block to block, or even house to house.\
The new version of the map tries to identify every location across the country capable of receiving broadband internet service and what level of internet service, if any, a company can provide at that location.\
But the map, as it currently exists, is far from perfect. Locations are missing, and the availability of information, as submitted by providers, often doesn’t match the reality on the ground. However, the process of using the map to help you shop around has the upside of the potential to reveal, and allow you to personally help fix, inaccuracies on the map. Members of the public can identify errors and submit corrections themselves.\
Since the map is a starting point for allocating more than $42 billion in federal broadband funding in America, by identifying inaccuracies on the map, you can help play a small part in potentially guiding money to where it is most urgently needed.\
Here’s how to search for a better deal on broadband.1. Find your home on the mapVisit the National Broadband Map at https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov and enter your address. Ideally, your correct address should immediately come up as an option with all of the availability data displayed for your perusal. But the map can be, at times, a little temperamental. It may take a bit of resubmitting your address and clicking around to get the data you’re looking for to display.\
If you can’t get the map to locate your address, skip to step four.2. Look at the providers claiming to offer you serviceAre any offering high speeds apart from the one you currently use? (Make sure the “Fixed broadband” button in the upper-right-hand corner is highlighted.)\
The type of each connection offered is listed in the “Technology” column and, broadly speaking, “Fiber to the Premises” is considered the best type of connection in terms of speed and reliability, followed by cable. Connections listed under copper are usually slow and outdated. Satellite and fixed wireless connections can be extremely useful if there are no other options available, but they are generally considered inferior to fiber and cable.3. Go to the providers’ websites to see their ratesProviders are identified by their corporate name, which is not necessarily the same one they present to the public when offering internet service. Charter Communications’ internet brand is Spectrum. Astound is listed under Radiate Holdings, LP. You may have to do a bit of Google sleuthing to figure out who is who.\
There’s no direct link on the map, so you need to search on Google (or your search engine of choice) to get the URL. For example, I searched “Radiate Holdings broadband” and found Astound’s website.\
Once you’re on an ISP’s website, enter your address into the tool that lets you search to see if the company serves your location—most ISPs have this in a pretty obvious place. You might find a faster speed, a lower price, or both.4. If what’s listed on the ISP’s website does not match what’s on the FCC’s mapHit the map’s “Availability Challenge” button and select the provider on whose site you noticed a contradiction. Decide if you want to file an official challenge, which forces the provider to check for errors, or submit an FYI to the FCC.\
If you file an official challenge, FCC staff will perform an initial review, and if it passes muster, the internet service provider has 60 days to either concede the challenge and accept your revision or make its own argument to the agency backing up why what it originally submitted to the map was correct. If the provider doesn’t concede the challenge, the company may get in touch with you directly about it and point out where you may have been mistaken. In any case, the ultimate decision about what to do regarding any challenge is left up to the FCC.\
If you’re submitting an FYI, your information will be used to inform the agency’s general efforts to improve the map but won’t kick off a challenge process.\
Fill out your information and, in the “reason for challenge” section, select either the ISP “does not offer the speed(s) reported” or the ISP “does not offer the technology reported” at your location. Describe your experience and, if you can, upload a screenshot to prove what you saw.\
You may not have gotten a better deal, but you just did your part to improve the FCC’s map! (Note: You have to either own or live at a location in order to submit an availability challenge there.)\
For more info on submitting an availability challenge, check out the FCC’s page on it here, and for info about what happens after submission, check out the FCC’s page explaining that here.5. If your address does not show up on the map at all, or shows up weirdly or incorrectlyFor example, people who live in apartment buildings with multiple units might see their building listed as a single-family home. If you see something wonky, or can’t find your location, look around on the map to find the building that most likely matches your home. Then, click the “Location Challenge” button, and then describe the issue. For more info, check out the FCC’s pages on submitting a location challenge and what happens after you submit.\
Again, no better deal for you, but you’re still helping improve the map!6. Tell us what you foundIf you followed the above steps, we’d love to know what happened. Did you find a better deal on your internet or submit a challenge to the FCC?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>US, Ukraine Talks Resume Early Next Week | Balance of Power</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG-9ZFWg--Y</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/wG-9ZFWg--Y?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 00:02:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA["Balance of Power" focuses on the intersection of politics and global business.

"One aspect of that is we need builders and it's part of the reason why earlier today we've brought back the level of the capital gains so that those who take those risks get the rewards."Temporarily waiving the one-week employment insurance waiting period.Temporarily allowing businesses to defer corporate income-tax payments and GST and HST remittances.Deploying a new financing facility (the Large Enterprise Economic and National Security Facility).Implementing a "one window" approval process to speed up major projects. Doubling the Indigenous Loan Guarantee to $10 billion, unlocking access to capital for First Nations, Inuit and Métis.Providing more funding for regional development agencies.Removing any mobility restrictions for federally regulated professions. Carney said removing barriers to the free movement of workers, goods and services would increase the size of Canada's economy by $250 billion — equivalent to more than $6,000 for every Canadian.He said he is proud the federal government moved on a number of projects today, such as the Cedar LNG and LNG Canada in B.C. and Port of Churchill in northern Manitoba. "It's high time to build," Carney said. Carney told reporters he would maintain a carbon emissions cap, but that legislation isn't enough to reduce emissions, which is why, he said, he is "focused on action."  "One of the projects, I firmly believe this, of national significance is major investments in carbon capture and storage," he said. "We have the opportunity not just to get emissions down but very importantly to create an entirely new industry that will serve Canadians well but will create exports and jobs and opportunities for many decades."The Conservative Party later alleged Carney was lying about his support of Canada's oil and gas industry."If Carney was sincere, he would immediately commit to the full repeal of the Liberals' C-69, the 'No More Pipelines' Act, C-48, the West Coast Tanker Ban, and the production cap," the party said in a statement. "Instead he doubled down on capping Canadian energy production."Carney's announcement about a national development strategy is also reminiscent of Conservative campaign promises.Just yesterday, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said in Jonquière, Que., that he plans to create "shovel-ready zones" with pre-approved construction permits for major resource or energy projects if elected.In 2019, Conservative Andrew Scheer, leader of the Official Opposition at the time, pledged that if elected, his government would build a single coast-to-coast energy corridor to transport natural resources.Most premiers in agreement: FordIn a scrum with reporters following the meeting, Ontario Premier Doug Ford said most premiers agreed about eliminating trade barriers, with he and the federal government intending to clear all exemptions."Nova Scotia is clearing all exemptions. As we move across the country, eventually everyone is going to hop on," he said. "They'll have no choice but to hop on board. Not forced, but there will be so much pressure within their territory or their province."Ford repeated that all options remain on the table, including potentially increasing an energy tax on the U.S. despite Alberta Premier Danielle Smith's opposition to that approach. WATCH | Carney presents national strategy:"Ontario will decide that. No other jurisdiction," he said. "I don't worry about her oil and she doesn't have to worry about my energy."Smith and Saskatchewan's Scott Moe and B.C.'s David Eby attended virtually, as did Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Andrew Furey who is in Japan for a trade mission.Ford reiterated that he would work with anyone as long as it's in Ontario's best interest. New Brunswick Premier Susan Holt voiced support for Carney, saying in French that she is "very happy" to have him as prime minister while Canada is under tariff threats. "From what I've seen of Mr. Carney and the conversations we have had, his passion for Canada shines through, his intelligence shines through," she said. She said she has yet to meet with Poilievre and doesn't have a comparison point. WATCH | How trade works in this border city: Legault wants 'global negotiation'  Shortly after arriving for the meeting, Quebec Premier François Legault told reporters that he wants the next prime minister to ask Trump for a "global" negotiation of a trade agreement rather than one that is piecemeal."Right now, Mr. Trump doesn't respect the agreement between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, especially on steel and aluminum. So it's important we renegotiate all the agreement," he said.He said premiers and the prime minister need to be careful about counter-tariffs and "eventual" counter-tariffs to maximize the negative impact on U.S. businesses but minimize the impact on Canadian ones. The Quebec premier said his province would be "open" to pipeline projects, due to Trump's threats, but there needs to be social acceptability.Yukon Premier Ranj Pillai acknowledged that, with increased focus on the North and the Arctic, it's important to hear the plans of all political parties for the region, especially in light of the rhetoric south of the border.Pillai said he wants to make sure the prime minister is aware that it is a "special moment in time for us" and that his visit to Iqaluit, the first domestic trip of his leadership of Canada, was "important and set a tone.""Other people are focusing on the North and we sure need to do the same," Pillai said. "In the first week, personally, I'm very impressed with what I've seen."Nunavut Premier P.J. Akeeagok agreed, saying it was great to see Carney underline "how important the North is and how much incredible of an opportunity we have to provide the country with an opportunity to diversify."Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew emphasized the need for a "solid plan for Canada's economy" because the country is "fighting a trade war on two fronts.""Trump tariffs certainly attract so much attention, but in Manitoba and in Western Canada, the tariffs from the People's Republic of China on canola and pork are having a major impact already," Kinew said.With files from CBC's Olivia Stefanovich, Lisa Mayor, Meagan Fitzpatrick, Kate McKenna, Raffy Boudjikanian]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Meta settles UK ‘right to object to ad-tracking’ lawsuit by agreeing not to track plaintiff</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/21/meta-settles-u-k-right-to-object-to-ad-tracking-lawsuit-by-agreeing-not-to-track-plaintiff/</link><author>Natasha Lomas</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 00:01:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A human rights campaigner, Tanya O’Carroll, has succeeded in forcing social media giant Meta not to use her data for targeted advertising.

From a report: The suit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in San Jose, seeks class action status and unspecified financial damages on behalf of those who purchased Apple Intelligence-capable iPhones and other devices. "Apple's advertisements saturated the internet, television, and other airwaves to cultivate a clear and reasonable consumer expectation that these transformative features would be available upon the iPhone's release," the suit reads. 

"This drove unprecedented excitement in the market, even for Apple, as the company knew it would, and as part of Apple's ongoing effort to convince consumers to upgrade at a premium price and to distinguish itself from competitors deemed to be winning the AI-arms race. [...] Contrary to Defendant's claims of advanced AI capabilities, the Products offered a significantly limited or entirely absent version of Apple Intelligence, misleading consumers about its actual utility and performance. Worse yet, Defendant promoted its Products based on these overstated AI capabilities, leading consumers to believe they were purchasing a device with features that did not exist or were materially misrepresented."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Are Anti-Musk Attacks Affecting Tesla, Elon?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_eCgA1gN5M</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/X_eCgA1gN5M?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 23:15:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Bloomberg's Max Chafkin shares his thoughts on what to make of Tesla's stock down almost 50% from its December peak and various anti-Musk attacks happening & whether or not Elon Musk is able to turn things around.

Perhaps we are wrong, but our assumption is based on the fact that over 60% of the Internet traffic now goes through mobile devices. That’s perfectly logical given that the number of smartphones has long exceeded the number of people on Earth!\
This has a heavy impact on the entertainment industry because providers in all niches now have to embrace the mobile-first approach so as to successfully attract new clients. The question we would like to discuss here is as follows: What does the future of mobile marketing in the entertainment sector entail? Let’s analyze it in the following sections.What’s Going On Right Now? The Current State of the IndustryIf you wish to know more about future events, you need to understand the present-day situation. So, what’s going on in the entertainment sector right now?\
First of all, we can see the dominance of mobile-oriented websites in all spheres of digital pastime all over the world. We can take the iGaming field as a good example – websites in this niche are either optimized for smartphone experience or possess a dedicated mobile app.\
Secondly, social media integration stands out as a crucial element of mobile marketing because major platforms such as Instagram are now the main channels for promoting literally all types of entertainment:\
At the same time, the success of streaming services (for instance Netflix or Disney+) also proves the unmatched potential of smartphone platforms in delivering on-the-go access to a huge portfolio of content options.Key Drivers of InnovationThe current state of affairs is pretty clear, but what are the main innovation drivers? We could discuss dozens of more or less influential elements, but the point is to cut a long story short here. First of all, Augmented Reality (AR) is the name of the game when it comes to smartphone entertainment. This innovation truly revolutionizes gaming as well as live events thanks to its mind-boggling interaction abilities.\
Similar things can be said for Artificial Intelligence (AI) as it enables entertainment providers to personalize their services. For instance, they can now easily provide personalized content recommendations instead of offering generic “one size fits all” services.\
At the same time, AI-driven chatbots play a big role in modern customer service operations – they give users tailored responses so as to maximize the quality of customer experiences. We also can’t help but mention  with faster streaming and download speeds. In a nutshell, this innovation is critical for the vast majority of modern entertainment options because it enables uninterrupted services.Strategies for Future Mobile Marketing SuccessStrategies for future mobile marketing success in the entertainment sector will mostly revolve around advanced data analytics (plus a few extra elements). We are talking about the need to analyze gigantic data volumes so as to truly understand audience preferences as well as common behaviors – details like these help craft highly personalized campaigns that resonate with users. More importantly, real-time data will enable adaptive marketing strategies that can respond swiftly to changing trends and audience feedback.\
Besides that, we expect to see more cross-platform integrations because many users frequently switch between devices. In such circumstances, it becomes important to allow users to easily transition from mobile to desktop to smart TVs without losing engagement. YouTube is a great example here as it lets viewers pick up exactly where they left off even if they change devices.\
Another interesting trend that will become even more important in the future is the advent of unified marketing campaigns. These are made in a way that maintains consistency in messaging as well as branding across multiple platforms. In our opinion, this is a superior solution when it comes to strengthening brand loyalty.\
Finally, we also expect to see much more interactive content. That’s because younger users expect providers to include gamification in their content or at least add some interactive storytelling elements. Such details already proved to be magnificent engagement boosters that stimulate active participation in real time.You Better Be Ready to AdaptThe bottom line is that every business or brand in the entertainment sector now has to think mobile-first in order to build a truly strong consumer base. This is mandatory for the long-term sustainability of any business, so you better be ready to adjust your services if you are also operating in this area: Those who fail to do so are likely to lose the market race against their more proactive competitors.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A lot More Room For 10-Year To Fall: JPMorgan&apos;s Misra</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYUHm58VKhc</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/UYUHm58VKhc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 23:00:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[JPMorgan Investment Management Portfolio Manager Priya Misra says there's more room for the 10-year to fall and Pimco Head of Short-Term Portfolio Management Jerome Schneider says the Fed will maintain optionality on inflation.

After browsing through the selection, a solid Lenovo laptop stood out; it had good hardware, decent battery life and no unnecessary gimmicks.As the customer approached the checkout and began paying for the new laptop, the salesperson turned and asked an unexpected question:“Would you like to prepay for Windows?”The customer blinked in surprise.“These computers you are displaying don’t include Windows?” the salesperson responded. “Windows comes with a 30-day trial offer.”Without hesitation, the customer responded firmly:“Absolutely not. I’m putting Linux on it.”The salesperson hesitated, as if hearing this statement for the first time.What many people don’t realize is that in certain regions, antitrust laws require manufacturers to sell computers with an option not to preinstall Windows. This is a response to decades of monopolistic practices, where users were forced to pay for a Microsoft license whether they wanted it or not. Some manufacturers have introduced Linux-preinstalled models or “no OS” options, though these remain relatively niche. In regions without such regulations, like the U.S., Windows-free computers are still uncommon outside of specialized retailers and business contracts.Some stores (depending on the country) are legally required to offer a refund for the cost of the Windows license if the customer chooses not to use it. This is, however, rarely advertised. Many people don’t even know they have a choice or that there is a choice for freedom.If you’re in the market for a new computer, don’t let the assumption of Windows dictate your purchase. Here’s how you can take control of your computing experience:Ask for a non-Windows option: Many stores don’t advertise it, but some models are available without a preinstalled OS.: If your country has consumer protection laws, you might be entitled to a refund for the Windows license if you don’t use it.Download and install openSUSE: Head to get.opensuse.org and choose the version that best fits your needs. Leap for long-term stability or Tumbleweed for the latest rolling updates.Enjoy a system without restrictions: No licensing fees, no activation headaches, and no locked-down software.Linux has always been there, unlocked and ready to go.So the next time you walk into a store looking for a new computer, remember; you have a choice. And that choice can be freedom. This is part of a series on Upgrade to Freedom where we offer reasons to transition from Windows to Linux.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Anduril might build a weapons factory in the UK</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/21/anduril-might-build-a-weapons-factory-in-the-uk/</link><author>Charles Rollet</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 21:51:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Anduril might build a factory in the U.K. as it expands beyond U.S. defense contracts.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Germany boosts massive European defense spending for Ukraine: How will the money be spent? | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqOGBqqDp-k</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/MqOGBqqDp-k?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 21:46:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[German lawmakers have agreed to provide an additional 11 billion euros in support for Ukraine in the coming years.

But I can tell you if we did, we're very well-equipped to handle it," he said.He also rejected reports that his adviser Elon Musk would be briefed on how the United States would fight a hypothetical war with China - a rare suggestion that his far-reaching role in the administration will face limits."Elon has businesses in China," he said. "And he would be susceptible, perhaps, to that."The president confirmed he would be speaking to China's president Xi Jinping about tariffs. Mr Trump also said there was flexibility on his controversial economic measure.It comes as Mr Trump expressed enthusiasm for possibly becoming a member of the Commonwealth.Sharing an article on his Truth Social network about plans to allegedly make the USA the next associate member, the President wrote: "I Love King Charles. Sounds good to me!"'Our allies are calling constantly'The plane's design remains a closely-held secret, but would likely include stealth, advanced sensors, and cutting-edge engines.The initial contract to proceed with production on the jets is worth an estimated $20bn (£15.5bn).Enable CookiesAllow Cookies OnceMr Trump said the jets will be built over several years and "it's something nobody has ever seen before"."Our allies are calling constantly," Trump said, adding foreign sales could be an option. "They want to buy them also."After saying the US would "tone down" the new jets by 10% for any sales to allies, Trump said: "[It] probably makes sense, because someday, maybe they're not our allies."Critics have questioned the cost and the necessity of the programme as the Pentagon is still struggling to fully produce its current most advanced jet, the F-35, which is expected to cost taxpayers more than $1.7tr (£1.01tr) over its lifespan.'I'll pay out of my own pocket'Meanwhile, Mr Trump said he will pay NASA astronauts  overtime pay after their trip to the International Space Station lasted nine months longer than planned.A reporter at the news conference said the pair are not entitled to overtime pay, prompting Mr Trump to say: "If I have to, I'll pay it out of my own pocket."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Youth uprisings in Turkey: What is driving students&apos; outrage over Istanbul mayor&apos;s arrest? | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnbe2VdW2FY</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/cnbe2VdW2FY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 21:20:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[DW's Julia Hahn speaks to protesters on the ground in Istanbul after the arrest of Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.

The tool will attempt to thwart AI companies that crawl websites without permission to collect training data for large language models that power AI assistants like ChatGPT.Cloudflare, founded in 2009, is probably best known as a company that provides infrastructure and security services for websites, particularly protection against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and other malicious traffic.Instead of simply blocking bots, Cloudflare's new system lures them into a "maze" of realistic-looking but irrelevant pages, wasting the crawler's computing resources. The approach is a notable shift from the standard block-and-defend strategy used by most website protection services.

(This is) significant enough to help continue to bring the prices down for right now” she said.The US is also in talks with other countries for additional imports.The move is part of a five-point plan Rollins unveiled in early March to combat the crisis which has driven egg prices up by 15.2% in January 2025—the largest monthly increase since June 2015. Over the past five years, egg prices have surged by 230%, according to Labor Department data.Rollins emphasized the importance of biosecurity measures to control the avian flu outbreak, which has devastated poultry populations for nearly two years.“The most proven way to solve for that is through biosecurity measures and what that means is locking down your barns,” she said. “Since we began doing that ... we've seen a significant decline in the bird flu.”The US is also working to repopulate egg-laying hens, a process Trump administration claims slowed by regulations from previous administrations."When our chicken populations are repopulated and we've got a full egg laying industry going again ... we then shift back to our internal egglayers and moving those eggs out onto the shelf," Rollins added.It was earlier announced that Türkiye will send 15,000 tons of eggs by June 2025 as a key short-term solution.Long-term measures include a $1 billion investment to stabilize the market and prevent future outbreaks. “This is a pretty big, massive plan,” Rollins said on February, expressing optimism about its impact.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Meta has revenue sharing agreements with Llama AI model hosts, filing reveals</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/21/meta-has-revenue-sharing-agreements-with-llama-ai-model-hosts-filing-reveals/</link><author>Kyle Wiggers</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 20:40:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In a blog post last July, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that “selling access” to Meta’s openly available Llama AI models “isn’t [Meta’s] business model.” Yet Meta does make at least some money from Llama through revenue-sharing agreements, according to a newly unredacted court filing.

Sometimes a Landscape painting is anything but a painting of a landscape. 

This is a film about José María Velasco, an artist who specialised in incredibly detailed landscapes, and was once a household name - but now is practically unknown outside the country of his birth, Mexico.

When thinking about Mexican nationalism and cultural identity, figures like Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera often take centre stage. Their iconic works have become synonymous with Mexican art. However, Velasco’s landscapes, particularly The Valley of Mexico, are often overlooked in these discussions.

Airport officials say "some flights" will resume tonight, with full operation beginning Saturday morning. Passengers are being told not to travel to the airport until their airlines give them the green light to do so. Europe's busiest airport was closed on Thursday night by a power outage caused by a fire at an electrical substation. The blaze is being investigated by counter-terror police, but they have said there are no indications of foul play.  The head of British Airways says it will be a major logisitical challenge for airlines to resume their flight schedules, as aircraft and crews may not be in place to fly when Heathrow reopens.

Theists may be conflicted: the centrality of human beings in this one universe, and, for Christians, the incarnation on Earth, versus the magnification of God with multiple universes.

The AI assistant adds a layer of automation and personal guidance to the , providing convenience, efficiency, and enhanced accessibility. With this added feature to the TOMI Wallet, users can now send funds and soon will be able to swap tokens, check prices and token details, monitor balances, and view transaction history via voice commands. The TOMI wallet, with the AI voice assistant, is available to download for  and .\
As AI features increasingly find their way into crypto platforms, products, and services, there is rising interest in utilizing advanced AI technologies like natural language processing (NLP) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) within Web3 wallets.\
Progress is being made to integrate AI voice commands into crypto wallets, but the industry hasn’t yet provided Web3 users with an all-encompassing solution. For example, Tether’s  is expected to provide enhanced security features, but it's only in the developmental stage and only caters to Bitcoin holders.\
TOMI’s new AI-powered voice assistant provides hands-free convenience to users, allowing them to engage with digital assets as they go about their daily routines. The AI voice assistant enables faster, mistake-free onboarding with its AI-driven step-by-step direction and contextual understanding, reducing the possibility of sending tokens to the wrong address or selecting the wrong network.\
By managing crypto through TOMI’s intuitive voice interface, users can save time by eliminating the need to navigate multiple screens. The TOMI Wallet’s AI voice assistant is the product of a technical collaboration with , a platform for creating advanced AI agents, who built and integrated the feature.\
The TOMI Wallet’s voice assistant integrates with users’ contacts, offering them the convenience of addressing a contact by name while the AI links them to the right address on the correct network. In the future, TOMI will extend these AI-powered capabilities to manage more aspects of the user experience across TOMI’s broader ecosystem. This could include identity verification, assistance engaging with DeFi protocols, handling NFT transactions, and more.“By embedding AI at the core of the TOMI Wallet, we aim to provide a more unified, intuitive, and smooth user experience,” says Moshe Hogeg, Founder and senior consultant at TOMI. “Soon, our users will be able to not only send crypto through AI voice assistant, but also check market data, interact with DeFi or NFT features, and more. As the first true AI voice assistant to be integrated into a crypto wallet, we aim to redefine the standard for crypto wallets going forward by emphasizing the UX.”TOMI is on a mission to increase digital freedom and build a more democratic and decentralized internet - where users have full control over their data, transactions, and communications.\
Through TOMI, messaging and crypto payments come together, enabling seamless intuitive financial interactions. By making transactions as easy as chatting, tomi is redefining how people connect and transact in the digital age. For more information, visit: :::tip

Male circumcision is done for religious, cultural or medical reasons.

In Africa, the WHO used male circumcision in the fight against AIDS. But more and more doctors say that the harm done by the procedure outweighs any medical benefits, and that this surgery is performed far too often.
Those affected are increasingly daring to go public, demanding that boys, too, be protected from circumcisions that are not medically necessary. Advocates say their right to physical integrity must be preserved. 
But few take it as far as Florian. He’s sure that his circumcision as a child wasn’t medically necessary. Moreover, his parents were not informed about alternative options. He’s taking his case to court.
The film explores the question of when circumcision actually makes  medical sense, and critically questions the ethics of this millennia-old practice.

Microchip implants have existed in some form for decades, and technology is now advanced enough to make them practical. Still, this field carries significant security concerns.The Growing Field of Implanted MicrochipsVeterinarians have implanted radiofrequency identification chips in pets since the 1990s. Human microchips  for medical use, though the technology did not catch on at the time.\
Fast-forward to today, and several leading tech companies and startups are researching microchip implants. Most famously, Elon Musk’s Neuralink has begun trials for brain-computer interfaces, which let users control electronic devices with their thoughts. Simpler chips that use RFID or near-field communication to store information or manage electronic payments are already available for commercial use.\
These chips can stand in for debit cards, give doctors access to vital medical information or work as keycards to access digital locks. Though they may not necessarily be widespread yet, they’re becoming increasingly prevalent.Cybersecurity Risks of Microchip ImplantsWhile chip implants can be highly convenient, they also open the door to unique cybersecurity risks. People should consider these potential dangers before proceeding with the technology.Contactless payments are one of the most practical ways to use an implanted microchip. However, this application means users are theoretically always vulnerable to skimming. Cybercriminals could intercept financial information if they get close enough to the implant, and because it’s essentially part of the user’s body, physical protections are minimal.\
Thankfully, while skimming has garnered much attention from RFID-blocking wallets, it’s not a common threat. NFC is even more secure, as it can  of the chip, making it difficult for criminals to get close enough. Still, the possibility may worry some consumers.A more concerning threat is the risk of cybercriminals installing malware onto an implanted chip. Researchers have proved that , even when the chip does not connect to an actively running device. Attackers may still need to get close to do so, but the damage might go far beyond skimming card details.\
Malware could cause a chip to malfunction. Depending on what people use their microchips for, that could leave them locked out of rooms or unable to access some electronics. The malware could also spread to anything that connects to the implant, including smart home devices or users’ phones.Finally, storing sensitive data in a wirelessly accessible chip in people’s bodies raises privacy questions, especially when it comes to BCIs. A BCI could theoretically , even including users’ thoughts if technology advances enough.\
A breach at a business storing its customers’ brainwaves could give criminals access to a massive amount of highly sensitive information. Even outside such an event, targeted advertising based on brain data may feel like a privacy violation. The possibility of government bodies accessing this information further complicates the ethical implications.Given these risks, implanted chips should implement a few extra security measures to protect their users. More best practices will emerge as the technology develops, but there are still a few must-have options to include.The companies offering microchip implants must adhere to zero-trust policies. Government agencies , and private businesses would be wise to adopt the same standards.\
Zero-trust architecture treats every transaction as a possible breach, verifying all data transmissions before allowing them. It also restricts access permissions as much as possible. That level of attention and responsiveness is crucial for anything involving as much sensitive information and potential complications as a chip in users’ bodies.Implementing stronger defenses for accessing the microchip and its connected services is also critical. Even a PIN is better than nothing. Hackers can , but they would still have to get within centimeters of an implanted NFC chip to do so.\
Setting and changing a PIN and managing the information and permissions of an implanted chip should require more robust protections. Strong passwords and multi-factor authentication are essential. Services should also restrict access attempts to stop unauthorized users from changing what it takes to get into an implant-based system.Finally, microchip implants will be more secure when they do less. While some organizations may not want to sacrifice functionality, limiting what a chip can do minimizes the ways an attacker can take advantage of it. Restricting long-range communications is vital for protection.\
The most robust defense implanted chips have today is that they only work within a few centimeters. A microchip with remote accessibility or Wi-Fi functionality suddenly becomes vulnerable to a much wider range of attacks and potential entry points. Maintaining a relative air gap by relying on NFC or RFID and restricting the kinds of data a chip can access and transmit make them far safer.Microchip Implants Are Exciting But Potentially RiskyDespite being around since the ‘90s, implanted microchip technology is still in its infancy. As this field grows and develops, its possibilities will expand, but so might its potential dangers.\
Cybersecurity considerations must come before expanded functionality and adoption. When these systems follow a security-by-design approach, people can use them confidently and safely. Failing to consider such risks in design and implementation could lead to catastrophic consequences.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Kwaku Otchere&apos;s Vision for the Future of Live Event Ticketing with Vipass</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/kwaku-otcheres-vision-for-the-future-of-live-event-ticketing-with-vipass?source=rss</link><author>Jon Stojan Journalist</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 16:30:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[\
Waiting patiently for physical tickets to arrive in the mail or making a trip to the box office is long gone. Event tech has grown to offer more convenient and secure options. While digital tickets have become the norm, challenges around security and ticket authentication still remain.  aims to push event tech into its next phase by solving this issue and offering enhanced convenience through a streamlined approach and even greater security for event-goers and organizers alike. Led by entrepreneur Kwaku Otchere, founder and CEO, Vipass is an events platform that combines secure digital solutions with a user-centric design to improve how event attendees experience live music and entertainment. Guided by Otchere's vision to redefine ticketing and live event engagement, this platform aims to create meaningful connections between event attendees and organizers to ensure a seamless and unforgettable experience."Our mission is to redefine what ticketing means by creating a more connected, immersive experience that goes beyond the transaction," \
The forward-thinking platform brings together ticketing, fan engagement, and digital innovation that enhance the entire event journey—not just the transaction. The Vipass system uses real-time engagement and communication, sending attendees personalized updates and event information before and during the event to create an interactive and integrated live event experience.\
This progressive ticketing system also addresses the primary concerns of ticketing: securing and authenticating a user's ticket. With physical tickets possibly leading to difficulties for both organizers and attendees, digital tickets have become a simpler method for authenticating a user's ticket. Vipass has a security guarantee, providing relief for attendees excited for an entertaining experience, with the platform's system eliminating fraud by ensuring every ticket is tied to a verified user and preventing unauthorized resale.Kwaku Otchere: Shaping the Future of Live EventsKwaku, whose career spans leadership roles at Apple and The Walt Disney Company, is now using his skills to elevate live events through Vipass. His journey, from his roots in Ghana to leading teams of professionals from around the world, shows his resilience, creativity, and drive to make a lasting impact.\
Kwaku founded Vipass with the mission to address a key issue in live events: a recurring disconnect where transactional ticketing overshadowed the potential for deeper engagement. Inspired by a personal desire to create meaning from loss, he had the vision to create a platform that would bridge this gap and create a more immersive, personalized journey for both event-goers and organizers.Past Successes and Future GoalsVipass's digital innovation in ticketing and event experiences is enhancing personalization, security, and fan engagement at music festivals and entertainment events across the globe.\
At last year's NYE event in Prague, Vipass teamed up with WeLit, which is one of the Czech Republic's leading entertainment brands and is known for delivering high-energy events that bring people together in celebration. With WeLit's New Year's Eve events famously high-profile and lavish, Vipass's collaborative efforts demonstrated how much easier the ticketing process can be with their innovative, secure, and seamless ticketing platform.\
With a major upcoming collaboration on the way, this platform aims to expand and influence the event industry in 2025. Stay tuned for the announcement of this major collaboration, which will showcase the next step in Vipass's growth and impact on the event technology space.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Go Interfaces, Explained for TypeScript Developers</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/go-interfaces-explained-for-typescript-developers?source=rss</link><author>Gokul Chandrasekaran</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 16:27:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[\
As someone who has worked primarily with Typescript over the last few years, learning Golang was challenging as much as it was stimulating.Recap: What are interfaces?Interfaces ensure consistent behavior without focusing on implementation details.Interfaces in TypeScript are structuralTypeScript is a  type system, one way it achieves this is using interfaces.\
They allow you to define the structure of objects you expect to handle within your code. Let’s take a common example of a  object.interface Person {
    name: string
    talk(text: string): void
    walk(to: string): string
}

const john: Person = {
    name: 'John Doe',
    talk: function (text: string): void {
        console.log('Speaking: ', text)
    },
    walk: function (to: string): string {
        return `${this.name} is at ${to}`
    },
}
Go’s interfaces are behavioralGo uses , meaning a struct matches an interface as long as it has matching method signatures.In Go, there is , all structs implicitly implement interfaces. The compiler deduces this during build time.// interface to be implemented by the Person struct
type PersonLike interface {
 Walk(string) string
 Talk(string)
}

// a `Person` struct
type Person struct {
 Name string
}

// Talk implements PersonBehavior.
func (p Person) Talk(text string) {
 println(p.Name + "is saying: '" + text)
}

// Walk implements PersonBehavior.
func (p Person) Walk(text string) string {
 return p.Name + "is at " + text
}

func main() {
 // declare `john` of PersonLike type
 var john PersonLike
 // assign an instance of the Person
 john = Person{}

 // invoke `.Walk` on the object
 println(john.Walk("home"))
}
In the above example, a struct is first created and then the methods are implemented on it.The compiler automatically detects the implementation of the interface by the  struct. Any struct having the method signature will satisfy the interface type\
The example below demonstrates how the same object instance can satisfy multiple interfaces, each containing a subset of its method signatures.package main

// interface to be implemented by the Person struct
type PersonLike interface {
 Walk(string) string
 Talk(string)
}

// interface that only has `Walk`
type Walker interface {
 Walk(string) string
}

// interface that only has `Talk`
type Talker interface {
 Talk(string)
}

// a `Person` struct
type Person struct {
 Name string
}

func (p Person) Talk(text string) {
 println(p.Name + "is saying: '" + text)
}

func (p Person) Walk(text string) string {
 return p.Name + "is at " + text
}

func main() {
 // declare `john` of PersonLike type
 var john PersonLike
 // assign an instance of the Person
 john = Person{}

 var johnWalker Walker
 // assign to object to `Walker` type
 johnWalker = john
 // invoke `.Walk`
 johnWalker.Walk("home")
 // Error below: johnWalker.Talk is undefined (Walker does not have Talk method)
 johnWalker.Talk("I am home")

 var johnTalker Talker
 johnTalker = john
 johnTalker.Talk("How do I get home?")

 // invoke `.Walk` on the object
 println(john.Walk("home")) // "John is at home"
 println(john.(Person).Name) // John
}
 allows you to create interfaces that have no methods declared i.e., it can hold a value of any type without any restrictions.The  equivalent would be the  typeconst empty: unknown = {}
Empty interfaces come in handy when the programmer knows the type but it is unknown to the type system. A common example would be de-serializing unknown types.func parse(val interface{}) (string, error) {
 // Gets the type of `value`
 switch value := val.(type) {
 case string:
  return string(value), nil
 default:
  return "", fmt.Errorf("unsupported data %#v", value)
 }
}
Methods in Go can have either Pointer receivers or value receivers. Depending on what is used the compiler treats them differently while matching interfaces.The following code won’t be compiled because of the error in line 39.package main

// interface that only has `Talk`
type Talker interface {
 Talk(string)
}

// a `PersonPtr` struct that has a pointer receiver for `Talk`
type PersonPtr struct {
 Name string
}

// Add implements PersonBehavior.
func (p *PersonPtr) Talk(text string) {
 println(p.Name + "is saying: '" + text)
}

// a `Person` struct that has a value receiver for `Talk`
type Person struct {
 Name string
}

// Add implements PersonBehavior.
func (p Person) Talk(text string) {
 println(p.Name + "is saying: '" + text)
}

func main() {
 // assign an instance of the Person
 var john Talker

 johnny := PersonPtr{}
 johnny.Talk("I can talk")

 // Error: PersonPtr does not implement Talker (method Talk has pointer receiver)
 john = johnny 

 john.Talk("This wont work")
}
This can however be fixed by replacing the assignment that  with:Since  is implemented only for , passing a pointer () to , ensuring it satisfies the interface.Go interfaces enable implicit implementation, reducing boilerplate and improving flexibility. allows structs to satisfy interfaces automatically if method signatures match.Multiple interface satisfaction lets a struct conform to different behaviors dynamically. provide a way to handle unknown types, useful for generics.Pointer vs. value receivers impact interface satisfaction - choosing the right one is key.Hope you enjoyed reading this as much as I enjoyed writing it. \n If you think this will be of help to someone?

Weathered: Inside the LA Firestorm
The 2025 LA Wildfires set a record as one of the most expensive and destructive in US history. As environmental shifts accelerate extreme fire conditions and communities expand into fire-prone landscapes, these devastating wildfires are becoming more common. But are they inevitable?

This blockchain-based technology has also come to the forefront thanks to projects such as BAYCs whose images have been purchased by celebrities and traded at very high prices as reported by several media. In this paper, we analyzed the phenomenon of NFTs, focusing on the class related to PFPs. We chose 18 projects based on our knowledge in the field and based on their importance in terms of volumes traded, users, and social activity. It was illustrated through analysis of social activity how the concept of social community is essential to ensure liquidity and value of PFP projects, i.e., used as social icons. The centrality and influence of the community related to BAYCs was demonstrated, that despite being second to CryptoPunks in terms of volumes traded, social activity is much higher and central to every other project in the industry. This work aimed to lay the groundwork for more in-depth future studies on understanding whether patterns and causality conditions may exist between elements such as the number of tweets, average price of a collection, Twitter users, and Ethereum wallet.[1] Oluwaseun Ajao, Jun Hong, and Weiru Liu. 2015.

For the past 6 months I've been working on an open source python library that implements differentiable geometric optics in PyTorch. It's very experimental still, but eventually the goal is to use it to design optical systems with a state of the art optimization framework and a beautiful code based API. Think OpenSCAD, but for optical systems.Not only is PyTorch's autograd an amazing general purpose optimizer, but torch.nn (the neural network building blocks) can be used pretty much out of the box to model an optical system. This is because there is a strong analogy to be made between layers of a neural network, and optical elements in a so-called sequential optical system. So the magic is that we can stack lenses as if we were stacking Conv2D and ReLu layers and everything works out. Instead of Conv2D you have ray-surface collision detection, instead of ReLu you have the law of refraction. Designing lenses is surprisingly like training a neural network.You should be able to `pip install torchlensmaker` to try it out, but I just set it up so let me know if there's any trouble.I was part of the Winter 1'24 batch at the Recurse Center (https://www.recurse.com/) working on this project pretty much full time.

ABSTRACT
Why are companies quietly using languages like Elm, OCaml, and Haskell?

No development department gets in trouble for going with industry standard languages, but that also means there is sometimes space to gain a considerable advantage over your competetion through language selection.

Drawing from notable success stories like Jane Street, Standard Chartered, Corvus, and Vendr, we will evaluate typed functional languages from a business perspective: What are the concrete business advantages gained by the companies using typed functional languages? When are these advantages likely (and unlikely) to translate to other businesses? And how can a business responsibly evaluate if the same advantages are available in their particular case? [...]

specific groups and streams of communication. We identified 60,060 different hashtags and thus constructed a weighted undirected graph where: each node represents a hashtag and each connection between two nodes represents the presence of a tweet in which both corresponding hashtags were used. As the weight of each node was assigned the number of tweets in which the corresponding hashtag was present, and as the weights of each connection the number of tweets having the two corresponding hashtags in common. Figure 6a illustrates in descending order which are the 20 most used hashtags: NFT, cryptopunks, and BAYC are the most significant ones. Beyond the 20th, namely art, the weights are much lower. Overall, the properties of the graph thus formed are shown in Table 3a: the graph consists of 762,950 connections, with an average weight of about 29,634 common tweets. The average clustering coefficient and the relatively significant number of connected components (that is 439) suggest the presence of highly specialized communities within this content graph. However, edge density is extremely low in this case, being hashtags mainly connected with some central hashtags (see below). Most likely for this reason, modularity has a low value. While\
Figure 6b illustrates in descending order which are the 20 hashtags with highest pagerank. Again, the values beyond the 20-th (famorie, related to the CryptoMories) the weight is much lower. Figure 4b illustrates the graph taking into account only these 20 hashtags, where the size of the nodes is proportional to the pagerank: again, as can be observed, the hashtags NFT, cryptopunks and BAYC are the most in"uential. We also performed a commonality analysis for the hashtags: this was summarized in Table 3c. As can be observed, the NFT hashtag is the one that is most common to all. The hashtags nftart, nftartist, and nftcollection are neither close to cryptopunks nor BAYC: this indicates how for more generic topics, and not only related to PFP, the discourses are less polarized on cryptopunks and BAYC.Figure 7 shows trends in volume, average price, tweets, and users (wallets and Twitter accounts) for a number of very different projects from the date of creation until April 14, 2022. BAYC, CryptoHodlers, Mekaverse, and mfers were considered. As can be seen, the BAYC built up a continuous engagement on Twitter where within a year the number of unique users talking about them grew exponentially, as did the average price, which went from 0.08ETH to more than 100ETH in less than a year. There are projects, such as CryptoHodlers, on the other hand, where although the creators try to build an ecosystem around their project by distributing comics or developing a new reserved NFT, the community has not grown, impacting the average price and liquidity (in terms of daily trades) of this project. Mekaverse and mfers, summarize these concepts: for the former we see how a high number of tweets in the early stages of the project resulted in an initial high exchange value where the figurines traded for a minimum price of 8ETH, then went to 10 times less as the number of tweets dropped. For the latter, on the other hand, we see that engagement in terms of daily tweets coincides with an increase in average price, and this occurs gradually and constantly after their release.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AlexNet Source Code Is Now Open Source</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/alexnet-source-code</link><author>Hansen Hsu</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81ODM2NzgzOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4OTUyOTc1Nn0.OQfBJOPQ7LvjN2mFru5XJOFO88BJTwYUvGspfN81dtA/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 13:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[First released in 2012, AlexNet sparked a revolution in AI and computer vision]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux 6.14 Sees Last Minute Fix For A Two Year Old Regression Causing A 30% Performance Drop</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.14-Sched-2-Year-Regress</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Submitted today ahead of the Linux 6.14 stable release expected Sunday is a lone scheduler fix for the kernel.

[...] not a dream of motor cars and high wages merely, but a dream of social order in which [everyone] shall be able to attain to the fullest stature of which they are innately capable, and be recognized by others for what they are, regardless of the fortuitous circumstances of birth or position”I wanted to know what these words meant to us today. I needed to know what parts of the American Dream we all still had in common. I had to make some sense of what was happening to our country. I’ve been writing on my blog since 2004, and on November 7th, I started writing the most difficult piece I have ever written. I asked so many Americans to tell me what the American Dream personally meant to them, and I wrote it all down.Later in November, I attended a theater performance of The Outsiders at my son’s public high school - an adaptation of the 1967 novel by S.E. Hinton. All I really knew was the famous “stay gold” line from the 1983 movie. But as I sat there in the audience among my neighbors, watching the complete story acted out in front of me by these teenagers, I slowly realized what "stay gold" meant: sharing the American Dream.We cannot merely attain the Dream. The dream is incomplete until we share it with our fellow Americans. That act of sharing is the final realization of everything the dream stands for.Thanks to S.E. Hinton, I finally had a name for my essay, “Stay Gold, America.” I published it on January 7th, with a Pledge to Share the American Dream.I encourage every American to contribute soon, however you can, to organizations you feel are effectively helping those most currently in need.But short term fixes are not enough.The Pledge To Share The American Dream requires a much more ambitious second act – deeper, long term changes that will take decades. Over the next five years, my family pledges half our remaining wealth to plant a seed toward foundational long term efforts ensuring that all Americans continue to have the same fair access to the American Dream.Let me tell you about my own path to the American Dream. It was rocky. My parents were born into deep poverty in Mercer County, West Virginia, and Beaufort County, North Carolina. Our family eventually clawed our way to the bottom of the middle class in Virginia. I won’t dwell on it, but every family has their own problems. We did not remain middle class for long. But through all this, my parents got the most important thing right: they loved me openly and unconditionally. That is everything. It’s the only reason I am standing here in front of you today.With my family’s support, I managed to achieve a solid public education in Chesterfield County, Virginia, and had the incredible privilege of an affordable state education at the University of Virginia. This is a college uniquely rooted in the beliefs of one of the most prominent Founding Fathers, Thomas Jefferson. He was a living paradox. A man of profound ideals and yet flawed – trapped in the values of his time and place. Still, he wrote “Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” at the top of the Declaration of Independence. These words were, and still are, revolutionary. They define our fundamental shared American values, although we have not always lived up to them. The American Dream isn’t about us succeeding, alone, by ourselves, but about connecting with each other and succeeding together as Americans.I’ve been concerned about wealth concentration in America ever since I watched a 2012 video by politizane illustrating just how extreme wealth concentration already was. I had no idea how close we were to the American Gilded Age from the late 1800s. This period was given a name in the 1920s by historians referencing Mark Twain’s 1873 novel, The Gilded Age, A Tale of Today. During this time, labor strikes often turned violent, with the Homestead Strike of 1892 resulting in deadly confrontations between workers and Pinkerton guards hired by factory owners. Rapid industrialization created hazardous working conditions in factories, mines, and railroads, where thousands died due to insufficient safety regulations and employers who prioritized profit over worker welfare.In January 2025, while I was still writing “Stay Gold, America”, we entered the period of greatest wealth concentration in the entirety of American history. As of 2021, the top 1% of households controlled 32% of all wealth, while the bottom 50% only have 2.6%. It's difficult to find more recent data, but wealth concentration has only intensified in the last four years.We can no longer say “Gilded Age”.We must now say “The First Gilded Age”.Today, in our  Gilded Age, more and more people find their path to the American Dream blocked. When Americans face unaffordable education, lack of accessible healthcare, or lack affordable housing, they aren't just disadvantaged – they're trapped, often burdened by massive debt. They have no stable foundation to build their lives. They watch desperately, working as hard as they can, while life simply passes them by, without even the freedom to choose their own lives.They don't have time to build a career. They don't have time to learn, to improve. They don't get to start a business. They can’t choose where their kids will grow up, or whether to have children at all, because they can’t afford to. Here in the land of opportunity, the pursuit of happiness has become an endless task for too many. We are denying people any real chance of achieving the dream that we promised them – that we promised the entire world – when we founded this nation. It is such a profound betrayal of everything we ever dreamed about. Without a stable foundation to build a life on, our fellow Americans cannot even  the American Dream, much less achieve it.I ask you this: as an American, what is the purpose of a dream left unshared with so many for so long? What’s happening to our dream? Are we really willing to let go of our values so easily? We’re Americans. We fight for our values, the values embodied in our dream, the ones we founded this country on. Why aren’t we sharing the American Dream? Why aren’t we giving everyone a fair chance at Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness by providing them the fundamentals they need to get there?The Dream worked for me, decades ago, and I deeply believe that the American Dream can still work for everyone – if we ensure every American has the same fair chance we did. The American Dream was never about a few people being extraordinarily wealthy. It’s about everyone having an equal chance to succeed and pursue their dreams – their own happiness. It belongs to them. I think we owe them at least that. I think we owe  at least that.What can we do about this? There are no easy answers. I can’t even pretend to have the answer, because there isn’t any one answer to give. Nothing worth doing is ever that simple. But I can tell you this: all the studies and all the data I’ve looked at have strongly pointed to one foundational thing we can do here in America over the next five years.Natalie Foster, co-founder of the Economic Security Project, makes a powerful case for the idea that, with all this concentrated wealth, we can offer a Guaranteed Minimum Income in the poorest areas of this country – the areas of most need, where money goes the farthest – to unlock vast amounts of untapped American potential. This isn’t a new idea. We’ve been doing this a while now in different forms, but we never called it Guaranteed Minimum Income.In , Thomas Paine proposed a retirement pension funded by estate taxes. It didn’t go anywhere, but it planted a seed. Much later we implemented the Social Security Act in  . The economic chaos of the Great Depression coupled with the inability of private philanthropy to provide economic security inspired Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal government programs. The most popular and effective program to emerge from this era was Social Security, providing a guaranteed income for retirees. Before Social Security,  of seniors lived in poverty. Today only 10% of seniors live in poverty.In his  book Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community, Martin Luther King Jr made the moral case for a form of UBI, Universal Basic Income. King believed that economic insecurity was at the root of all inequality. He stated that a guaranteed income — direct cash disbursements — was the simplest and best way to fight poverty.In , Congress established the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, providing direct cash assistance to low-income elderly, blind, and disabled individuals with little or no income. This cash can be used for food, housing, and medical expenses, the essentials for financial stability. As of January, 2025, over 7.3 million people receive SSI benefits.In 1975, Congress passed the Tax Reduction Act, establishing the Earned Income Tax Credit. This tax credit benefits working-class parents with children, encouraging work by increasing the income of low-income workers. In 2023, it lifted about 6.4 million people out of poverty, including 3.4 million children. According to the Census Bureau, it is the second most effective anti-poverty tool after Social Security.In 2019, directly inspired by King, mayor Michael Tubbs – at age 26, one of the youngest mayors in American history – launched the $3 million Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration. It provided 125 residents with $500 per month in unconditional cash payments for two years. The program found that recipients experienced improved financial stability, increased full-time employment, and enhanced well-being.In my “Stay Gold, America” blog post, I referenced the Robert Frost "Stay Gold" poem and S.E. Hinton's famous famous novel The Outsiders, urging us to retain our youthful ideals as we grow older. Ideals embodied in the American Dream.Which brings us to another Robert Frost poem, the Road Not Taken. Our proposal to ensure access to the American Dream is to follow the path less travelled by:  Guaranteed Minimum Income. GMI is a simpler, more practical, more scalable plan to directly address the root of economic insecurity with minimum bureaucracy.We are partnering with GiveDirectly, who oversaw the most GMI studies in the United States, and OpenResearch, who just completed the largest, most detailed GMI study ever conducted in this country in 2023. We are working together to launch a new Guaranteed Minimum Income initiative in rural American communities.Network effects within communities explain why equality of opportunity is so effective, and why a shared American Dream is the most powerful dream of all. The potential of the American Dream becomes vastly greater as more people have access to it, .They share it with their families, their friends, and their neighbors. The groundbreaking, massive 2023 OpenResearch UBI study data showed that when you give money to the poorest among us, they consistently go  to share that money with others in desperate need.The power of opportunity is not in what it can do for one person, but how it connects and strengthens bonds between people. When you empower a couple, you allow them to build a family. When you empower families, you allow them to build a community. When you guarantee fundamentals, you're providing a foundation for those connections to grow and thrive. This is the incredible power and value of community. That is what we are investing in – each other.A system where there are no guarantees creates conflict. It creates inequality. A massive concentration of wealth in so few hands weakens connections between us and prevents new ones. America began as a place of connection. Millions of us came together to build this nation, not individually, but together. Equality is connection, and connection is more valuable than any product any company will ever sell you.You may ask, why focus on rural communities? There are consistently higher poverty rates in rural counties, with fewer job opportunities, lower wages, and worse access to healthcare and education. It’s not a new problem, either — places like Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta, and American Indian reservations have been stuck in poverty for decades, with some counties like Oglala Lakota, SD (55.8%) and McDowell, WV (37.6%) hitting extreme levels. Meanwhile, urban counties rarely see numbers that high. The data from the US Census and USDA Economic Research Service make it clear: if you’re poor in America, being rural makes it even harder to escape.Rural areas offer smaller populations, which is helpful because we need to start small with lots of tightly controlled studies that we can carefully scale and improve on for larger areas. We hope to build a large body of scientific data showing that GMI really does improve the lives, and the communities, of our fellow Americans.The initial plan is to target a few counties that I have a personal connection to, and are still currently in poverty, decades later:My father was born in Mercer County, West Virginia, where the collapse of coal mining left good people struggling to survive. Their living and their way of life is now all but gone, and good jobs are hard to find.My mother’s birthplace, Beaufort County, North Carolina, has been hit just as hard, with farming and factory jobs disappearing and families left wondering what’s next.Our third county is yet to be decided, but will be a community also facing the same systemic, generational obstacles to economic stability and achieving the American Dream.We will work with existing local groups to coordinate GMI studies where community members choose to enroll. We will conduct outreach and and provide mentorship to these opt-in study participants. It will be teamwork between Americans.We hope Veterans will play a crucial role in our effort. We plan to work with local communities and veteran-serving organizations to engage veterans to support and execute our GMI programs – the same veterans who served our country with distinction, returning home with exceptional leadership skills and a deep commitment to their communities. Their involvement ensures these programs reflect core American values of self-reliance and community service to fellow Americans. We'll also partner with established community organizations — churches, civic groups, community colleges, local businesses. These partnerships help integrate our GMI studies with existing support systems, rather than creating new ones.GiveDirectly and OpenResearch will build on their existing body of work, gathering extensive data from these refined studies. We'll measure employment, entrepreneurship, education, health, and community engagement. We'll conduct regular interviews with participants to understand their experience. How is this working for you? How can we make it better? You tell us. How can we make it better together?Economic security isn't only about individual well-being – it's the bedrock of democracy. When people aren't constantly worried about feeding themselves, feeding their family, having decent healthcare, having a place to live… we have given them room to breathe. We have given them freedom. The freedom to raise their children, the freedom to start businesses, the freedom to choose where they work, the freedom to volunteer... the freedom to .This isn’t about ideology or government. It’s about us, as Americans, working together to invest in our future – possibly the greatest unlocking of human potential in our entire history. I do not say these things lightly. I’ve seen it work. I’ve looked at all the existing study data. A little bit of money is incredibly transformational for people in poverty – the people who need it the most – the people who cannot live up to their potential because they’re so busy simply trying to survive. Imagine what they could do if we gave them just a little breathing room.GMI is a long term investment in the future of what America should be, the way we wrote it down in the Declaration of Independence, perhaps incompletely – but our democracy was always meant to be malleable, to change, to adapt, and improve.I’d like to conclude by mentioning Aaron Swartz. He was a precocious teenage programmer much like myself. Aaron helped develop RSS web feeds, co-founded Reddit, and worked with Creative Commons to create flexible copyright licenses for the common good. He used technology to make information universally accessible to everyone.Aaron created a system to download public domain court documents from PACER, a government database that charged fees for accessing what he believed should be freely available public information. A few years later, while visiting MIT under their open campus policy and as a research fellow at Harvard, he used MIT's network to download millions of academic articles from JSTOR, another fee-charging online academic journal repository, intending to make this knowledge freely accessible. Since taxpayers had funded much of this research, why shouldn’t that knowledge be freely available to everyone?What Aaron saw as an act of academic freedom and information equality, authorities viewed as a crime—he was arrested in January 2011 and charged with multiple felonies for what many considered to be nothing more than accessing knowledge that should have been freely available to the public in the first place.Despite JSTOR declining to pursue charges and MIT eventually calling for leniency, federal prosecutors aggressively pursued felony charges against Aaron with up to 35 years in prison. Facing overwhelming legal pressure and the prospect of being labeled a felon, Aaron took his own life at 26. This sparked widespread criticism of prosecutorial overreach and prompted discussions about open access to information. Deservedly so. Eight days later, in this very hall, there was a standing room only memorial service praising Aaron for his commitment to the public good.Aaron pursued what was right for we, the people. He chose to build the public good despite knowing there would be risks. He chose to be an activist. I think we should all choose to be activists, to be brave, to stand up for our defining American principles. There are two things I ask of you today.Visit https://www.givedirectly.org/rural-us where we'll be documenting our journey and findings from the initial three GMI rural county studies. Let’s find out together how guaranteed minimum income can transform American lives.Talk about Guaranteed Minimum Income in your communities. Meet with your state and local officials. Share the existing study data. Share outcomes. Ask them about conducting GMI studies like ours in your area. We tell ourselves stories about why some people succeed and others don't. Challenge those stories. Economic security is not . It is an  in vast untapped American potential in the poorest areas of this country.My family is committing 50 million dollars to this endeavor, but imagine if we had even more to share. Imagine how much more we could do, if we build this together, starting today. Decades from now, people will look back and wonder why it took us so long to share our dream of a better, richer, and fuller life with our fellow Americans.I hope you join us on this grand experiment to share our American Dream. I believe everyone deserves a fair chance at what was promised when we founded this nation: Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of The American Dream. – Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?

There was a part of me--a very naive part, mind you--that thought it might be a bit fun to see how long I could go without making mention of the game in this review as a sort of challenge for myself. Clearly, I have already failed.However, the context in which InZoi exists matters. Whereas the world is filled with cozy games, life sims, and plenty of other titles that reside somewhere between the two, extremely few play quite like The Sims. It goes without saying that Maxis created something extremely special back in 2000--something so creative, charming, innovative, and intricately designed that seemingly no other game studio has even attempted to put an end to its quarter-century long reign over the life-sim genre. There is no denying that the franchise's reputation has taken some hits over the years, primarily due to its perceived stagnation and parent company EA's predatory monetization tactics. As this discontent has grown, so too has the number of people looking for a viable competitor. And now, thanks to InZoi, we have a fresh-faced and utterly gorgeous new challenger.Considering its good looks were among the first of many things that made InZoi such a highly anticipated title, I'll start by saying that it is just as mind-blowing to look at as it seems. From its UI to its city streets to its pouty-lipped, pop star-esque characters, everything about InZoi is visually remarkable. Vast amounts of customization options, an immersive and ever-changing open world, and an intense focus on making things feel true-to-life yet just more grand further polish this gem. And I was relieved that, despite all its luster, the game ran perfectly fine on my less-than-great gaming PC (AMD Ryzen 5 3600/NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Super). And yet, I was ultimately forced to reckon with the fact that, in my 20 or so hours with InZoi, I missed out on something incredibly important: having fun. Though InZoi is impressive, immersive, and brimming with potential, in its current state there is a sterility and lifelessness that is hard to move past. This paired with stale gameplay ultimately made InZoi a game I desperately to enjoy, but seldom did.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Most Interesting Linux 6.14 Features From NTSYNC To AMD Ryzen AI &amp; Rust Abstractions</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.14-Features-Reminder</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 20:28:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Barring any last minute issues or hesitation by Linus Torvalds, the Linux 6.14 kernel is aiming for releasing as stable this coming Sunday on 23 March.

I wanted to share my analytics app with you.This project came from requirements to track certain very frequent events. I found that the cost to do it on a regular analytics product was much more than i was willing to pay. Secondly, I also wanted to use as few resources as possible. So I thought it may be a good idea to create something that may be useful for myself (and hopefully others).I have been able to track a great number of events with this using ~20 MB of storage and memory which is incredible. I have been really impressed by golang as a language and as an ecosystem and would love to work more in this language going forward.Some Highlights: 
1. No dependencies 
2. CLI based management 
3. Web based UI (and the server to serve it) included in the program. 
4. 20 MB install size.   
5. 20 MB memory use while running.  
6. Minimal storage requirements because it aggregates events.This can be a great fit for anyone who wants to have a lightweight minimal analytics for internal events.I am looking forward to your comments and feedback.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Burnout Machine</title><link>https://unionize.fyi/</link><author>flxfxp</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 18:24:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Originally written by Biozombie, published in 2600 Hacker Quarterly, Autumn 2024
            Let’s get real for a minute: the tech industry loves to sell us on the myth of the "dream
            job."
            You
            know
            the
            pitch - beanbags in the office, free kombucha on tap, and "Agile" processes that are supposed to
            make
            everything
            more flexible, more efficient. But the reality? It’s a meat grinder that chews up developers,
            sysadmins,
            and
            infosec pros and spits them out the other side - burnt out, disillusioned, and disposable.
        
            We’re living in a world where billion dollar tech companies expect us to live and breathe code,
            demanding
            80
            hour weeks under the guise of "passion." And what do we get in return? Burnout, anxiety, and the
            constant
            threat
            of layoffs. It’s time to face facts: this industry is not your friend. It’s a machine, and
            unless we
            start
            organizing, it’s going to keep grinding us down. It’s time to talk about unionizing tech jobs.
        
            Remember when Agile was supposed to save us all? Flexible sprints, self-organizing teams - yeah, right. In
            practice, Agile has been twisted into a tool for management to push us harder and faster. They say
            it’s
            about
            "responding to change over following a plan," but let’s be honest - it’s about dangling
            more
            carrots
            and keeping
            us on a treadmill that never stops. The sprint becomes a marathon, and we’re the ones paying the
            price.

        
            And then there’s burnout. We’re in an industry where burnout isn’t just common -
            it’s
            expected. If you’re not
            pulling all-nighters, you’re "not committed." If you’re not answering Slack messages at
            midnight,
            you’re "not a
            team player." This culture is toxic, and it’s only getting worse. The relentless churn of
            projects,
            the
            constant
            pressure to innovate, and the ever-present threat of obsolescence create a perfect storm of stress. And
            what’s
            the industry’s solution? A mindfulness app and a lecture on work-life balance. Give me a break.
        
            Let’s talk about job security - because there isn’t any. The tech industry loves to hype itself
            as a
            meritocracy, where the best and the brightest rise to the top. But in reality, it’s a meat market. As
            soon
            as
            you’re not "on the cutting edge," you’re out. Outsourcing, contract work, gig economy
            bullshit -
            it’s all
            designed to keep us insecure, to keep us grinding away at the next big thing with no guarantee that
            we’ll
            have a
            job next week, next month, or next year.
        
            Companies love to brag about their innovation, but the real innovation is finding new ways to make us
            disposable. Permanent employment? That’s for suckers. Why pay benefits and offer job security when
            they
            can
            churn through contractors and freelancers like cheap code? And don’t get me started on those
            non-compete
            clauses
            - designed to keep you locked down and terrified to make a move that might actually be good for your career.
        
            And let’s not forget the ethical side of this equation. We’re being asked to build the future,
            to
            develop AI,
            blockchain, and all the other buzzword technologies that are supposed to change the world. But at what cost?
            How
            many of us have been forced to work on projects that make us sick to our stomachs - surveillance tech, data
            mining tools, algorithms that reinforce social biases - because we don’t have the power to say no?
        
            That’s the kicker. We’re the ones building the damn future, but we have no say in how it’s
            built. We don’t get
            to decide whether our code is used for good or for evil. And as long as we’re isolated, as long as
            we’re afraid
            to speak up because we might lose our jobs, nothing will change.
        
            This industry isn’t going to fix itself. The billionaires at the top aren’t going to suddenly
            grow a
            conscience,
            and they aren’t going to give us the power to push back. That power has to come from us - from
            organizing,
            from
            resisting, from breaking - unless we organize, unless we unionize.
        
            Unionizing isn’t just about getting better pay or benefits (though we desperately need both).
            It’s
            about taking
            back some control. It’s about having a say in how we work, what we work on, and how we’re
            treated.
            It’s about
            saying no to the endless churn, the burnout culture, the gig economy bullshit.
        
            And don’t let anyone tell you it’s impossible. The Alphabet Workers Union at Google?
            They’re
            showing us it can
            be done. They’re standing up to one of the biggest companies in the world and saying,
            "Enough." We
            need
            more of
            that. We need to take that energy and spread it across the industry - across all the companies that are
            profiting off our sweat and tears.
        
            Hackers, we’ve always been about more than just code. We’ve been about freedom - freedom of
            information, freedom
            from control. Unionizing is the next logical step. It’s about taking the hacker ethos into the
            workplace,
            about
            organizing to protect ourselves and each other.
         Talk to your coworkers. Break the silence. The first step to
                organizing is
                realizing you’re not alone.
            Support Existing Efforts: If you’re in a company where union efforts are already
                underway, get
                involved.
                If not, start thinking about how you can start one.
             We’re hackers - we know how to communicate securely, how to
                organize without
                being
                detected. Let’s use those skills to build something real, something that can stand up to the
                powers that
                be. Let’s make sure that any union platform we build isn’t
                just about wages and
                hours, but
                about ethics too. We need to have a say in what we’re building and how it’s used.
            The tech industry is a runaway train, and if we don’t do something soon, we’re going to get run
            over. The
            burnout, the job insecurity, the nightmares - it’s all going to keep getting worse unless we take a
            stand.
            Unionizing isn’t just a nice idea - it’s a necessity.
        
            So let’s do what hackers do best: let’s disrupt. Let’s take the tools they’ve given
            us, the skills we’ve
            honed, and use them to build something better. Let’s unionize. Let’s take back our industry,
            take back our
            jobs, and take back our futures.
        
            The future of tech is being written right now, and it’s up to us to decide what kind of story it will
            be.
            Let’s make it a story we can be proud of.

I’m Tony, co-founder of Inngest. I wanted to share AgentKit, our Typescript multi-agent library we’ve been cooking and testing with some early users in prod for months.Although  OpenAI’s Agents SDK has been launched since, we think an Agent framework should offer more deterministic and flexible routing, work with multiple model providers, embrace MCP (for rich tooling), and support the unstoppable and growing community of TypeScript AI developers by enabling a smooth transition to production use cases.This is why we are building AgentKit, and we’re really excited about it for a few reasons:Firstly, it’s simple. We embrace KISS principles brought by Anthropic and HuggingFace by allowing you to gradually add autonomy to your AgentKit program using primitives:- Agents: LLM calls that can be combined with prompts, tools, and MCP native support.- Networks: a simple way to get Agents to collaborate with a shared State, including handoff.- State: combines conversation history with a fully typed state machine, used in routing.- Routers: where the autonomy lives, from code-based to LLM-based (ex: ReAct) orchestrationThe routers are where the magic happens, and allow you to build deterministic, reliable, testable agents.AgentKit routing works as follows: the network calls itself in a loop, inspecting the State to determine which agents to call next using a router.  The returned agent runs, then optionally updates state data using its tools.  On the next loop, the network inspects state data and conversation history, and determines which new agent to run.This fully typed state machine routing allows you to deterministically build agents using any of the effective agent patterns — which means your code is easy to read, edit, understand, and debug.This also makes handoff incredibly easy: you define when agents should hand off to each other using regular code and state (or by calling an LLM in the router for AI-based routing). This is similar to the OpenAI Agents SDK but easier to manage, plan, and build.Then comes the local development and moving to production capabilities.AgentKit is compatible with Inngest’s tooling, meaning that you can test agents using Inngest’s local DevServer, which provides traces, inputs, outputs, replay, tool, and MCP inputs and outputs, and (soon) a step-over debugger so that you can easily understand and visually see what's happening in the agent loop.In production, you can also optionally combine AgentKit with Inngest for fault-tolerant execution.  Each agent’s LLM call is wrapped in a step, and tools can use multiple steps to incorporate things like human-in-the-loop.  This gives you native orchestration, observability, and out-of-the-box scale.You will find the documentation as an example of an AgentKit SWE-bench and multiple Coding Agent examples.It’s fully open-source under the Apache 2 license.If you want to get started:- npm: npm i @inngest/agent-kitWe’re excited to finally launch AgentKit; let us know what you think!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ChatLoopBackOff Episode 51 (WasmEdge)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHTGNKV9lXA</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/VHTGNKV9lXA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 17:22:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[WasmEdge is a CNCF Sandbox project that is a high-performance WebAssembly runtime optimized for cloud-native and edge computing use cases.

Excited to share our MCP Server at Hyperbrowser - something we’ve been working on for a few days. We think it’s a pretty neat way to connect LLMs and IDEs like Cursor / Windsurf to the internet.Our MCP server exposes seven tools for data collection and browsing:1. `scrape_webpage` - Extract formatted (markdown, screenshot etc) content from any webpage2. `crawl_webpages` - Navigate through multiple linked pages and extract LLM-friendly formatted content3. `extract_structured_data` - Convert messy HTML into structured JSON4. `search_with_bing` - Query the web and get results with Bing search5. `browser_use_agent` - Fast, lightweight browser automation with the Browser Use agent6. `openai_computer_use_agent` - General-purpose automation using OpenAI’s CUA model7. `claude_computer_use_agent` - Complex browser tasks using Claude computer useYou can connect the server to Cursor, Windsurf, Claude desktop, and any other MCP clients with this command `npx -y hyperbrowser-mcp` and a Hyperbrowser API key. We're running this on our cloud browser infrastructure that we've been developing for the past few months – it handles captchas, proxies, and stealth browsing automatically.Some fun things you can do with it: (1) deep research with claude desktop, (2) summarizing the latest HN posts, (3) creating full applications from short gists in Cursor, (3) automating code review in cursor, (4) generating llms.txt for any website with windsurf, (5) ordering sushi from windsurf (admittedly, this is just for fun - probably not actually going to do this myself).We're building this server in the open and would love feedback from anyone building agents or working with web automation. If you find bugs or have feature requests, please let us know! One big issue with MCPs in general is that the installation UX sucks and auth credentials have to be hardcoded. We don’t have a solution to this right now but Anthropic seems to be working on something here so excited for that to come out. Love to hear any other complaints / thoughts you have about the server itself, Hyperbrowser, or the installation experience.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Inside the &apos;Woman, Life, Freedom&apos; protest movement in Iran | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAKaZZcHtgU</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/oAKaZZcHtgU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 17:00:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Filmed in secret, this documentary is a behind-the-scenes look at the "Woman, Life, Freedom” uprising in Iran. The story begins a few weeks after the death of Jina Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish student who died on 16 September 2022.

She had allowed a few strands of hair to escape from her veil. Members of the Iranian morality police beat her so severely that she died of her injuries. The regime in Tehran has denied all responsibility for her death, which triggered nationwide mass protests under a slogan that echoed all around the world: "Woman, Life, Freedom”.

Iranian filmmaker Shorresh Afkari filmed in secret, smuggling the footage out of the country to a colleague in France. His documentary gives a voice to people who, like large sections of the Iranian population, have run out of strength and patience.

For example, the film observes a young couple who dream of being able to express their love openly and in complete freedom. We also meet a taxi driver, who ends up in prison as a bitter opponent of the regime. His mother tries to protect him at all costs. A painter continues to practise her art despite censorship; a doctor secretly treats demonstrators. A young man is prepared to do anything for cash, even sell one of his kidneys. Just like men who dare to protest, women who show their hair in public and publicly oppose the regime still face harsh punishment, including the death penalty. For this reason, many interviewees speak off-camera to protect their anonymity.

DESCRIPTION
Sarah Wells and Anne Currie dive into “The Cloud Native Attitude” and uncover why it’s more than just using cloud infrastructure. It’s about breaking bottlenecks, embracing rapid change, and aligning the entire organization.

Anne reflects on how Kubernetes has risen since the book’s first edition, but the core principles remain. They discuss why CI/CD is key, how cloud native supports sustainability, and why true transformation demands more than just a lift-and-shift. The conversation wraps up with practical advice on identifying real bottlenecks and securing buy-in for a successful cloud native journey.

It turns out that it's the default loading page for Anubis, a proof-of-work challenger that blocks AI scrapers that are causing outages.By now, it should be pretty clear that this is no coincidence. AI scrapers are getting more and more aggressive, and - since FOSS software relies on public collaboration, whereas private companies don't have that requirement - this is putting some extra burden on Open Source communities.So let's try to get more details – going back to Drew's blogpost. According to Drew, LLM crawlers don't respect robots.txt requirements and include expensive endpoints like git blame, every page of every git log, and every commit in your repository. They do so using random User-Agents from tens of thousands of IP addresses, each one making no more than one HTTP request, trying to blend in with user traffic.Due to this, it's hard to come off with a good set of mitigations. Drew says that several high-priority tasks have been delayed for weeks or months due to these interruptions, users have been occasionally affected (because it's hard to distinguish bots and humans), and - of course - this causes occasional outages of SourceHut.Drew here does not distinguish between which AI companies are more or less respectful of robots.txt files, or more accurate in their user agent reporting; we'll be able to look more into that later.Finally, Drew points out that this is not some isolated issue. He says, All of my sysadmin friends are dealing with the same problems, [and] every time I sit down for beers or dinner to socialize with sysadmin friends it's not long before we're complaining about the bots. [...] The desperation in these conversations is palpable.Which brings me back to yesterday's KDE GitLab issues. According to Ben, part of the KDE sysadmin team, all of the IPs that were performing this DDoS were claiming to be MS Edge, and were due to Chinese AI companies; he mentions that Western LLM operators, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, were at least setting a proper UA - again, more on this later.The solution - for now - was to ban the version of Edge that the bots were claiming to be, though it's hard to believe that this will be a definitive solution; these bots do seem keen on changing user agents to try to blend in as much as possible.Indeed, GNOME has been experiencing issues since a last November; as a temporary solution they had rate-limited non-logged in users from seeing merge requests and commits, which obviously also caused issues for real human guests.The solution the eventually settled to was switching to Anubis. This is a page that presents a challenge to the browser, which then has to spend time doing some math and presenting the solution back to the server. If it's right, you get access to the website.According to the developer, this project is "a bit of a nuclear response, but AI scraper bots scraping so aggressively have forced my hand. I hate that I have to do this, but this is what we get for the modern Internet because bots don't conform to standards like robots.txt, even when they claim to".However, this is also causing user issues. When a lot of people open the link from the same place, it might happen that they get served some higher-difficulty exercise that will take some time to complete; there's one user reporting one minute delay, and another - from his phone - having to wait around two minutes.Why? Well, a GitLab link was pasted in a chatroom! Similarly, the same happened when the Triple Buffering GNOME merge request was posted to Hacker News, and thus received a lot of attention over there. As the developer said, it's a nuclear option for crawlers, but it also has human consequences.Over Mastodon, one GNOME sysadmin, Bart Piotrowski, kindly shared some numbers to let people fully understand the scope of the problem. According to him, in around two hours and a half they received 81k total requests, and out of those only 3% passed Anubi's proof of work, hinting at 97% of the traffic being bots – an insane number!That said, at least  worked. Other organizations are having a harder time dealing with these scrapers.As an example, here's Jonathan Corbet, who runs the FOSS news source LWN, warns users that the website might be "occasionally sluggish"… due to DDoS from AI scraper bots. He claims that "only a small fraction of our traffic is serving actual human readers", and at some point, the bots "decides to hit us from hundreds of IP addresses at once. [..] They don't identify themselves as bots, and robots.txt is the only thing they don't read off the site".Many expressed solidarity, including Kevin Fenzi, sysadmin for the Fedora project. They've also been having issues with AI scrapers: firstly, one month ago they had to fight to get pagure.io to stay alive:However, things got  over time, so they had to block a bunch of subnets, which has also impacted many real users. Out of desperation, at one point Kevin decided to ban the entire country of Brazil to get things to work again; to my understanding, this ban is still in effect, and it's not so clear where a longer-term solution might be found.And, as Neal Gompa points out, even this blocking an entire country only gets you so far, and apparently the Fedora infrastructure has been "regularly down for weeks" because of AI scrapers.Another project that's been hit by this issue  is Inkscape. According to Martin Owens, it's not "the usual Chinese DDoS from last year, but from a pile of companies that started ignoring our spider conf and started spoofing their browser info. I now have a Prodigius block list. If you happen to work for a big company doing AI, you may not get our website anymore".And, well, Martin is not the only developer who has built a "prodigious block list". Even BigGrizzly from Frama software was flooded by a bad LLM crawler, and built a list of 460K IPs with spoofed user agents to ban; he's offering to share the list around.One more comprehensive attempt at this is the "ai.robots.txt" project, an open list of web crawlers associated with AI companies. They offer a robots.txt that implements the Robots Exclusion Protocol and a .htaccess file that will return an error page when getting a request from any AI crawler in their list.We can get some more numbers about the crawlers if we go a few months back. Here's a post by Dennis Schubert about the Diaspora (an Open Source decentralized social network) infrastructure, where he says that "looking at the traffic logs made him impressively angry".In the blogpost, he claims that one fourth of his entire web traffic is due to bots with an OpenAI user agent, 15% is due to Amazon, 4.3% is due to Anthropic, and so on. Overall, we're talking about 70% of the entire requests being from AI companies.they don’t just crawl a page once and then move on. Oh, no, they come back every 6 hours because lol why not. They also don’t give a single flying fuck about , because why should they. [...] If you try to rate-limit them, they’ll just switch to other IPs all the time. If you try to block them by User Agent string, they’ll just switch to a non-bot UA string (no, really). This is literally a DDoS on the entire internet.A similar number is given by the Read the Docs project. In a blogpost called, "AI crawlers need to be more respectful", they claim that blocking  AI crawlers immediately decreased their traffic by 75%, going from 800GB/day to 200GB/day. This made the project save up around $1500 a month.The rest of the article is pretty impressive too; they talk about crawlers downloading tens of terabytes of data within a few days, or more. It's hard to block them entirely, since they use various different IPs.I do wonder how much of this is scraping for training data, and how much instead is the "search" function that most LLMs provide; nonetheless, according to Schubert, "normal" crawlers such as Google's and Bing's only add up to a fraction of a single percentage point, which hints at the fact that other companies are indeed abusing their web powers.But it's not just scrapers, or I would've titled this "AI scrapers", not "AI companies". Another issue that Open Source community have been fighting with is AI-generated bug reports, as an example.This was first reported by Daniel Stenberg of the Curl project, in a blogpost titled "The I in LLM stands for Intelligence". Curl offers a bug bounty project, but lately, they've noticed that many bug reports are generated by AI. These look credible and take up a lot of developer time to check, but they also contain the typical hallucinations you'd expect from AIs. It's pretty crazy to have to go through your own code because a bug report confidently tells you there's some critical security issue to fix, and … not finding it, because the whole issue is just AI hallucination.A similar issue was reported by Seth Larson, who's on the security report triage team for CPython, pip, urllib3, Requests, and more. He says,Recently I've noticed an uptick in extremely low-quality, spammy, and LLM-hallucinated security reports to open source projects. The issue is in the age of LLMs, these reports appear at first-glance to be potentially legitimate and thus require time to refute.This is a pretty big issue. As he points out, responding to security reports is expensive, and responding to invented but credible bug reports causes some significant additional burden on maintainers, which might drive them out of the Open Source world.The article ends with a request: please, do not use AI or LLM systems for detecting vulnerabilities. He says, "These systems today cannot understand code, finding security vulnerabilities requires understanding code AND understanding human-level concepts like intent, common usage, and context.".Again, I want to point out that these issues impact disproportionately on the FOSS world; not only do Open Source projects often have less resources compared to commercial products, but - being community-driven projects - much more of their infrastructure is public and thus susceptible to both crawlers and AI-generated bug reports or issues. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Frontend Treadmill</title><link>https://polotek.net/posts/the-frontend-treadmill/</link><author>Kerrick</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 12:25:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A lot of frontend teams are very convinced that rewriting their frontend will lead to the promised land. And I am the bearer of bad tidings.If you are building a product that you hope has longevity, your frontend framework is the least interesting technical decision for you to make. And all of the time you spend arguing about it is wasted energy.If your product is still around in 5 years, you’re doing great and you should feel successful. But guess what? Whatever framework you choose will be obsolete in 5 years. That’s just how the frontend community has been operating, and I don’t expect it to change soon. Even the popular frameworks that are still around are completely different. Because change is the name of the game. So they’re gonna rewrite their shit too and just give it a new version number.Product teams that are smart are getting off the treadmill. Whatever framework you currently have, start investing in getting to know it deeply. Learn the tools until they are not an impediment to your progress. That’s the only option. Replacing it with a shiny new tool is a trap.I also wanna give a piece of candid advice to engineers who are searching for jobs. If you feel strongly about what framework you want to use, please make that a criteria for your job search. Please stop walking into teams and derailing everything by trying to convince them to switch from framework X to your framework of choice. It’s really annoying and tremendously costly.I always have to start with the cynical take. It’s just how I am. But I do want to talk about what I think should be happening instead.Companies that want to reduce the cost of their frontend tech becoming obsoleted so often should be looking to get back to fundamentals. Your teams should be working closer to the web platform with a lot less complex abstractions. We need to relearn what the web is capable of and go back to that.Let’s be clear, I’m not suggesting this is strictly better and the answer to all of your problems. I’m suggesting this as an intentional business tradeoff that I think provides more value and is less costly in the long run. I believe if you stick closer to core web technologies, you’ll be better able to hire capable engineers in the future without them convincing you they can’t do work without rewriting millions of lines of code.And if you’re an engineer, you will be able to retain much higher market value over time if you dig into and understand core web technologies. I was here before react, and I’ll be here after it dies. You may trade some job marketability today. But it does a lot more for career longevity than trying to learn every new thing that gets popular. And you see how quickly they discarded us when the market turned anyway. Knowing certain tech won’t save you from those realities.I couldn’t speak this candidly about this stuff when I held a management role. People can’t help but question my motivations and whatever agenda I may be pushing. Either that or I get into a lot of trouble with my internal team because they think I’m talking about them. But this is just what I’ve seen play out after doing this for 20+ years. And I feel like we need to be able to speak plainly.This has been brewing in my head for a long time. The frontend ecosystem is kind of broken right now. And it’s frustrating to me for a few different reasons. New developers are having an extremely hard time learning enough skills to be gainfully employed. They are drowning in this complex garbage and feeling really disheartened. As a result, companies are finding it more difficult to do basic hiring. The bar is so high just to get a regular dev job. And everybody loses.What’s even worse is that I believe a lot of this energy is wasted. People that are learning the current tech ecosystem are absolutely not learning web fundamentals. They are too abstracted away. And when the stack changes again, these folks are going to be at a serious disadvantage when they have to adapt away from what they learned. It’s a deep disservice to people’s professional careers, and it’s going to cause a lot of heartache later.On a more personal note, this is frustrating to me because I think it’s a big part of why we’re seeing the web stagnate so much. I still run into lots of devs who are creative and enthusiastic about building cool things. They just can’t. They are trying and failing because the tools being recommended to them are just not approachable enough. And at the same time, they’re being convinced that learning fundamentals is a waste of time because it’s so different from what everybody is talking about.I guess I want to close by stating my biases. I’m a web guy. I’ve been bullish on the web for 20+ years, and I will continue to be. I think it is an extremely capable and unique platform for delivering software. And it has only gotten better over time while retaining an incredible level of backwards compatibility. The underlying tools we have are dope now. But our current framework layer is working against the grain instead of embracing the platform.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Data Centers Seek Engineers Amid a Talent Shortage</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-center-jobs</link><author>Aaron Mok</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81ODE0Nzg4OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc5MTU0MDk4MH0.7LI-qDSKFYznOSDLoWtKO6c0VGgev65zA6sWdU-_hF4/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 12:00:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The AI boom is driving demand for more skilled electrical engineers]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google Developing &quot;Live Update Orchestrator&quot; As New Means Of Live Linux Kernel Updates</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Google-Live-Update-Orchestrator</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 11:11:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[While there is Kpatch, Ksplice, and other live patching solutions already in use for patching a running Linux kernel for deploying security updates without downtime, Google engineers are developing the Live Update Orchestrator as a new means of transitioning to a new updated kernel with minimal downtime...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>DAMON Self-Tuned Memory Tiering Shows Nice Improvement For Linux Servers</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/DAMON-Self-Tuned-Memory-Tiering</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 10:52:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Linux developer SeongJae Park has posted a set of patches for the Linux kernel's wonderful DAMON code to provide for self-tuned memory tiering that "just works" and is racking up some nice performance wins...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google Chrome Replacing FreeType With Rust-Written Skrifa For Font Handling</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Google-Chrome-Going-Skrifa</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 10:37:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Google Chrome web browser is moving away from the FreeType font rendering library and instead pursuing their Skrifa project that is written in Rust for better memory safety around handling fonts on the web...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Miracle-WM 0.5 Released For Mir-Based Wayland Tiling Window Manager</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Miracle-WM-0.5-Released</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 10:16:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Miracle-WM 0.5 released on Wednesday as their first update of 2025 for this Mir-based Wayland tiling window manager.

JOYRIDE is a short-form interview series that pairs younger generations with older adults as they explore the world together on trishaw bikes. The show is inspired by the global non-profit, Cycling Without Age, which takes older adults on trishaw outings to feel the wind in their hair. From the Santa Barbara coastline to Barcelona beaches, each episode unlocks the lived experiences of today’s older generation, who have become increasingly removed from the flow of daily life. This series will create new conditions for generations to collide, share experiences, and be inspired by a sense of place and nostalgia.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Another Round Of Rust Compiler Improvements Merged For GCC 15.1</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/More-Rust-Merged-GCC-15.1</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 15:28:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A few days ago there was a batch of 145 patches merged for the upcoming GCC 15 compiler release to enhance the Rust "gccrs" front-end.

But a new conflict, was about to begin.  
The following day, US President Bush made a statement to the people of Iraq. "In my view… the Iraqi people should put Saddam aside”. At the very  same time, Shia in the south and Kurds in the north took control of much of the country. Saddam’s regime was on the ropes. But the uprisings would end in disaster. 

In this final episode of our Gulf War series, we’ll explore the aftermath of the war. Why did the uprisings fail? Why didn’t the Coalition intervene? And how did the Gulf War set the stage for the 2003 invasion of Iraq?

Metaphysics is the deepest probe of reality. It is the branch of philosophy that discerns the most general features of the world. When focused on God, metaphysics seeks insights not readily apparent, such as possible contradictions (or coherence) among various traits of God. Other topics include tensions between God and time, and God and abstract objects.

One minute, I was in an immigration office talking to an officer about my work visa, which had been approved months before and allowed me, a Canadian, to work in the US. The next, I was told to put my hands against the wall, and patted down like a criminal before being sent to an Ice detention center without the chance to talk to a lawyer.I grew up in Whitehorse, Yukon, a small town in the northernmost part of Canada. I always knew I wanted to do something bigger with my life. I left home early and moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, where I built a career spanning multiple industries – acting in film and television, owning bars and restaurants, flipping condos and managing Airbnbs.In my 30s, I found my true passion working in the health and wellness industry. I was given the opportunity to help launch an American brand of health tonics called Holy! Water – a job that would involve moving to the US.I was granted my trade Nafta work visa, which allows Canadian and Mexican citizens to work in the US in specific professional occupations, on my second attempt. It goes without saying, then, that I have no criminal record. I also love the US and consider myself to be a kind, hard-working person.I started working in California and travelled back and forth between Canada and the US multiple times without any complications – until one day, upon returning to the US, a border officer questioned me about my initial visa denial and subsequent visa approval. He asked why I had gone to the San Diego border the second time to apply. I explained that that was where my lawyer’s offices were, and that he had wanted to accompany me to ensure there were no issues.After a long interrogation, the officer told me it seemed “shady” and that my visa hadn’t been properly processed. He claimed I also couldn’t work for a company in the US that made use of hemp – one of the beverage ingredients. He revoked my visa, and told me I could still work for the company from Canada, but if I wanted to return to the US, I would need to reapply.I was devastated; I had just started building a life in California. I stayed in Canada for the next few months, and was eventually offered a similar position with a different health and wellness brand.I restarted the visa process and returned to the same immigration office at the San Diego border, since they had processed my visa before and I was familiar with it. Hours passed, with many confused opinions about my case. The officer I spoke to was kind but told me that, due to my previous issues, I needed to apply for my visa through the consulate. I told her I hadn’t been aware I needed to apply that way, but had no problem doing it.Then she said something strange: “You didn’t do anything wrong. You are not in trouble, you are not a criminal.”I remember thinking: Why would she say that? Of course I’m not a criminal!She then told me they had to send me back to Canada. That didn’t concern me; I assumed I would simply book a flight home. But as I sat searching for flights, a man approached me.There was no explanation, no warning. He led me to a room, took my belongings from my hands and ordered me to put my hands against the wall. A woman immediately began patting me down. The commands came rapid-fire, one after another, too fast to process.They took my shoes and pulled out my shoelaces.“What are you doing? What is happening?” I asked.“You are being detained.”“I don’t understand. What does that mean? For how long?”That would be the response to nearly every question I would ask over the next two weeks: “I don’t know.”They brought me downstairs for a series of interviews and medical questions, searched my bags and told me I had to get rid of half my belongings because I couldn’t take everything with me.“Take everything with me where?” I asked.A woman asked me for the name of someone they could contact on my behalf. In moments like this, you realize you don’t actually know anyone’s phone number anymore. By some miracle, I had recently memorized my best friend Britt’s number because I had been putting my grocery points on her account.I gave them her phone number.They handed me a mat and a folded-up sheet of aluminum foil.I was taken to a tiny, freezing cement cell with bright fluorescent lights and a toilet. There were five other women lying on their mats with the aluminum sheets wrapped over them, looking like dead bodies. The guard locked the door behind me.For two days, we remained in that cell, only leaving briefly for food. The lights never turned off, we never knew what time it was and no one answered our questions. No one in the cell spoke English, so I either tried to sleep or meditate to keep from having a breakdown. I didn’t trust the food, so I fasted, assuming I wouldn’t be there long.On the third day, I was finally allowed to make a phone call. I called Britt and told her that I didn’t understand what was happening, that no one would tell me when I was going home, and that she was my only contact.They gave me a stack of paperwork to sign and told me I was being given a five-year ban unless I applied for re-entry through the consulate. The officer also said it didn’t matter whether I signed the papers or not; it was happening regardless.I was so delirious that I just signed. I told them I would pay for my flight home and asked when I could leave.Then they moved me to another cell – this time with no mat or blanket. I sat on the freezing cement floor for hours. That’s when I realized they were processing me into real jail: the Otay Mesa Detention Center.I was told to shower, given a jail uniform, fingerprinted and interviewed. I begged for information.“How long will I be here?”“I don’t know your case,” the man said. “Could be days. Could be weeks. But I’m telling you right now – you need to mentally prepare yourself for months.”I felt like I was going to throw up.I was taken to the nurse’s office for a medical check. She asked what had happened to me. She had never seen a Canadian there before. When I told her my story, she grabbed my hand and said: “Do you believe in God?”I told her I had only recently found God, but that I now believed in God more than anything.“I believe God brought you here for a reason,” she said. “I know it feels like your life is in a million pieces, but you will be OK. Through this, I think you are going to find a way to help others.”At the time, I didn’t know what that meant. She asked if she could pray for me. I held her hands and wept.I felt like I had been sent an angel.I was then placed in a real jail unit: two levels of cells surrounding a common area, just like in the movies. I was put in a tiny cell alone with a bunk bed and a toilet.The best part: there were blankets. After three days without one, I wrapped myself in mine and finally felt some comfort.For the first day, I didn’t leave my cell. I continued fasting, terrified that the food might make me sick. The only available water came from the tap attached to the toilet in our cells or a sink in the common area, neither of which felt safe to drink.Eventually, I forced myself to step out, meet the guards and learn the rules. One of them told me: “No fighting.”“I’m a lover, not a fighter,” I joked. He laughed.I asked if there had ever been a fight here.“In this unit? No,” he said. “No one in this unit has a criminal record.”That’s when I started meeting the other women.That’s when I started hearing their stories.And that’s when I made a decision: I would never allow myself to feel sorry for my situation again. No matter how hard this was, I had to be grateful. Because every woman I met was in an even more difficult position than mine.There were around 140 of us in our unit. Many women had lived and worked in the US legally for years but had overstayed their visas – often after reapplying and being denied. They had all been detained without warning.If someone is a criminal, I agree they should be taken off the streets. But not one of these women had a criminal record. These women acknowledged that they shouldn’t have overstayed and took responsibility for their actions. But their frustration wasn’t about being held accountable; it was about the endless, bureaucratic limbo they had been trapped in.The real issue was how long it took to get out of the system, with no clear answers, no timeline and no way to move forward. Once deported, many have no choice but to abandon everything they own because the cost of shipping their belongings back is too high.I met a woman who had been on a road trip with her husband. She said they had 10-year work visas. While driving near the San Diego border, they mistakenly got into a lane leading to Mexico. They stopped and told the agent they didn’t have their passports on them, expecting to be redirected. Instead, they were detained. They are both pastors.I met a family of three who had been living in the US for 11 years with work authorizations. They paid taxes and were waiting for their green cards. Every year, the mother had to undergo a background check, but this time, she was told to bring her whole family. When they arrived, they were taken into custody and told their status would now be processed from within the detention center.Another woman from Canada had been living in the US with her husband who was detained after a traffic stop. She admitted she had overstayed her visa and accepted that she would be deported. But she had been stuck in the system for almost six weeks because she hadn’t had her passport. Who runs casual errands with their passport?One woman had a 10-year visa. When it expired, she moved back to her home country, Venezuela. She admitted she had overstayed by one month before leaving. Later, she returned for a vacation and entered the US without issue. But when she took a domestic flight from Miami to Los Angeles, she was picked up by Ice and detained. She couldn’t be deported because Venezuela wasn’t accepting deportees. She didn’t know when she was getting out.There was a girl from India who had overstayed her student visa for three days before heading back home. She then came back to the US on a new, valid visa to finish her master’s degree and was handed over to Ice due to the three days she had overstayed on her previous visa.There were women who had been picked up off the street, from outside their workplaces, from their homes. All of these women told me that they had been detained for time spans ranging from a few weeks to 10 months. One woman’s daughter was outside the detention center protesting for her release.That night, the pastor invited me to a service she was holding. A girl who spoke English translated for me as the women took turns sharing their prayers – prayers for their sick parents, for the children they hadn’t seen in weeks, for the loved ones they had been torn away from.Then, unexpectedly, they asked if they could pray for me. I was new here, and they wanted to welcome me. They formed a circle around me, took my hands and prayed. I had never felt so much love, energy and compassion from a group of strangers in my life. Everyone was crying.At 3am the next day, I was woken up in my cell.“Pack your bag. You’re leaving.”I jolted upright. “I get to go home?”The officer shrugged. “I don’t know where you’re going.”Of course. No one ever knew anything.I grabbed my things and went downstairs, where 10 other women stood in silence, tears streaming down their faces. But these weren’t happy tears. That was the moment I learned the term “transferred”.For many of these women, detention centers had become a twisted version of home. They had formed bonds, established routines and found slivers of comfort in the friendships they had built. Now, without warning, they were being torn apart and sent somewhere new. Watching them say goodbye, clinging to each other, was gut-wrenching.I had no idea what was waiting for me next. In hindsight, that was probably for the best.Our next stop was Arizona, the San Luis Regional Detention Center. The transfer process lasted 24 hours, a sleepless, grueling ordeal. This time, men were transported with us. Roughly 50 of us were crammed into a prison bus for the next five hours, packed together – women in the front, men in the back. We were bound in chains that wrapped tightly around our waists, with our cuffed hands secured to our bodies and shackles restraining our feet, forcing every movement into a slow, clinking struggle.When we arrived at our next destination, we were forced to go through the entire intake process all over again, with medical exams, fingerprinting – and pregnancy tests; they lined us up in a filthy cell, squatting over a communal toilet, holding Dixie cups of urine while the nurse dropped pregnancy tests in each of our cups. It was disgusting.We sat in freezing-cold jail cells for hours, waiting for everyone to be processed. Across the room, one of the women suddenly spotted her husband. They had both been detained and were now seeing each other for the first time in weeks.The look on her face – pure love, relief and longing – was something I’ll never forget.We were beyond exhausted. I felt like I was hallucinating.The guard tossed us each a blanket: “Find a bed.”There were no pillows. The room was ice cold, and one blanket wasn’t enough. Around me, women lay curled into themselves, heads covered, looking like a room full of corpses. This place made the last jail feel like the Four Seasons.I kept telling myself: Do not let this break you.Thirty of us shared one room. We were given one Styrofoam cup for water and one plastic spoon that we had to reuse for every meal. I eventually had to start trying to eat and, sure enough, I got sick. None of the uniforms fit, and everyone had men’s shoes on. The towels they gave us to shower were hand towels. They wouldn’t give us more blankets. The fluorescent lights shined on us 24/7.Everything felt like it was meant to break you. Nothing was explained to us. I wasn’t given a phone call. We were locked in a room, no daylight, with no idea when we would get out.I tried to stay calm as every fiber of my being raged towards panic mode. I didn’t know how I would tell Britt where I was. Then, as if sent from God, one of the women showed me a tablet attached to the wall where I could send emails. I only remembered my CEO’s email from memory. I typed out a message, praying he would see it.Through him, I was able to connect with Britt. She told me that they were working around the clock trying to get me out. But no one had any answers; the system made it next to impossible. I told her about the conditions in this new place, and that was when we decided to go to the media.She started working with a reporter and asked whether I would be able to call her so she could loop him in. The international phone account that Britt had previously tried to set up for me wasn’t working, so one of the other women offered to let me use her phone account to make the call.We were all in this together.With nothing to do in my cell but talk, I made new friends – women who had risked everything for the chance at a better life for themselves and their families.Through them, I learned the harsh reality of seeking asylum. Showing me their physical scars, they explained how they had paid smugglers anywhere from $20,000 to $60,000 to reach the US border, enduring brutal jungles and horrendous conditions.One woman had been offered asylum in Mexico within two weeks but had been encouraged to keep going to the US. Now, she was stuck, living in a nightmare, separated from her young children for months. She sobbed, telling me how she felt like the worst mother in the world.Many of these women were highly educated and spoke multiple languages. Yet, they had been advised to pretend they didn’t speak English because it would supposedly increase their chances of asylum.Some believed they were being used as examples, as warnings to others not to try to come.Women were starting to panic in this new facility, and knowing I was most likely the first person to get out, they wrote letters and messages for me to send to their families.It felt like we had all been kidnapped, thrown into some sort of sick psychological experiment meant to strip us of every ounce of strength and dignity.We were from different countries, spoke different languages and practiced different religions. Yet, in this place, none of that mattered. Everyone took care of each other. Everyone shared food. Everyone held each other when someone broke down. Everyone fought to keep each other’s hope alive.I got a message from Britt. My story had started to blow up in the media.Almost immediately after, I was told I was being released.My Ice agent, who had never spoken to me, told my lawyer I could have left sooner if I had signed a withdrawal form, and that they hadn’t known I would pay for my own flight home.From the moment I arrived, I begged every officer I saw to let me pay for my own ticket home. Not a single one of them ever spoke to me about my case.To put things into perspective: I had a Canadian passport, lawyers, resources, media attention, friends, family and even politicians advocating for me. Yet, I was still detained for nearly two weeks.Imagine what this system is like for every other person in there.A small group of us were transferred back to San Diego at 2am – one last road trip, once again shackled in chains. I was then taken to the airport, where two officers were waiting for me. The media was there, so the officers snuck me in through a side door, trying to avoid anyone seeing me in restraints. I was beyond grateful that, at the very least, I didn’t have to walk through the airport in chains.To my surprise, the officers escorting me were incredibly kind, and even funny. It was the first time I had laughed in weeks.I asked if I could put my shoelaces back on.“Yes,” one of them said with a grin. “But you better not run.”“Yeah,” the other added. “Or we’ll have to tackle you in the airport. That’ll really make the headlines.”I laughed, then told them I had spent a lot of time observing the guards during my detention and I couldn’t believe how often I saw humans treating other humans with such disregard. “But don’t worry,” I joked. “You two get five stars.”When I finally landed in Canada, my mom and two best friends were waiting for me. So was the media. I spoke to them briefly, numb and delusional from exhaustion.It was surreal listening to my friends recount everything they had done to get me out: working with lawyers, reaching out to the media, making endless calls to detention centers, desperately trying to get through to Ice or anyone who could help. They said the entire system felt rigged, designed to make it nearly impossible for anyone to get out.The reality became clear: Ice detention isn’t just a bureaucratic nightmare. It’s a business. These facilities are privately owned and run for profit.Companies like CoreCivic and GEO Group receive government funding based on the number of people they detain, which is why they lobby for stricter immigration policies. It’s a lucrative business: CoreCivic made over $560m from Ice contracts in a single year. In 2024, GEO Group made more than $763m from Ice contracts.The more detainees, the more money they make. It stands to reason that these companies have no incentive to release people quickly. What I had experienced was finally starting to make sense.This is not just my story. It is the story of thousands and thousands of people still trapped in a system that profits from their suffering. I am writing in the hope that someone out there – someone with the power to change any of this – can help do something.The strength I witnessed in those women, the love they gave despite their suffering, is what gives me faith. Faith that no matter how flawed the system, how cruel the circumstances, humanity will always shine through.Even in the darkest places, within the most broken systems, humanity persists. Sometimes, it reveals itself in the smallest, most unexpected acts of kindness: a shared meal, a whispered prayer, a hand reaching out in the dark. We are defined by the love we extend, the courage we summon and the truths we are willing to tell.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Automatically tuning thresholds</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dwdNRxzksE</link><author>probabl</author><category>dev</category><category>ml</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/2dwdNRxzksE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 08:30:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIat2Cdg661wF5DQDWTQAmg">Dev - Probabl</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[You can get a lot of traction in your data science career if you are good at picking the right threshold.

In a way, they are a new type of AI PC architecture specifically built for running neural networks, and five major PC manufacturers will build them.These desktop systems, first previewed as "Project DIGITS" in January, aim to bring AI capabilities to developers, researchers, and data scientists who need to prototype, fine-tune, and run large AI models locally. DGX systems can serve as standalone desktop AI labs or "bridge systems" that allow AI developers to move their models from desktops to DGX Cloud or any AI cloud infrastructure with few code changes.Huang explained the rationale behind these new products in a news release, saying, "AI has transformed every layer of the computing stack. It stands to reason a new class of computers would emerge—designed for AI-native developers and to run AI-native applications."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Nvidia announces “Rubin Ultra” and “Feynman” AI chips for 2027 and 2028</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/nvidia-announces-rubin-ultra-and-feynman-ai-chips-for-2027-and-2028/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/nvidia_chip_hero_1-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 21:10:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Tuesday at Nvidia's GTC 2025 conference in San Jose, California, CEO Jensen Huang revealed several new AI-accelerating GPUs the company plans to release over the coming months and years.

While social media has helped tourism boom and brought prosperity to the region, it also poses a threat to the landscape and its unique historical heritage.

Cappadocia draws more than four million tourists every year. The region in Turkey is famous for its extraordinary "fairy chimneys" - carved-out boulders, some of which are still inhabited. This wonderland became a UNESCO World Heritage Site decades ago.
Every day, hot air balloons carrying tourists drift across valleys dotted with "fairy chimneys." The rock formations, the hot air balloons, the sunrise - the setting couldn't be more instagrammable.
Mustafa Köse knows exactly how to get the perfect shot that tourists want for their social media posts. "Cultural tourism is dead," the photographer says - all people want now is something to show off with on Instagram. It's a development he struggles with, even though he makes a decent living giving the tourists what they want. 
Zehra Demircan took over her father's "cave hotel" a couple of years ago. He did his best to preserve the family's "fairy chimneys" in their original state so that the accommodation still provides an authentic glimpse of Cappadocia. Zehra Demircan is following suit, modernizing the hotel as carefully as possible. Like Mustafa Köse, she sometimes feels conflicted about her visitors. "We had a group here who didn't visit anything for the entire week," she says. "The whole time, they just took photos for social media."
Local activist Mükremin Tokmak has been fighting for years against the destruction of this unique landscape. He was appalled by the construction of a highway cutting through the historical region, paving the way for even more tourism. He documents the effects of the construction work on the valleys and the old churches that stood here. He hasn't given up hope that tourism can be held in check.

The wound that had once marred her face was mostly gone, with only a thin, barely discernible scar left behind. Naoe's face slowly heals over the course of Shadows' story and the changing of the in-game seasons, providing a visual metaphor for the game's thematic journey through the ugliness of revenge, the healing process of forgiveness and moving beyond tragedy with enough time and support. It's a story that has incredible moments between Naoe and fellow protagonist Yasuke but largely feels listless during its muddled second act. And although Naoe's shinobi fantasy is the best Assassin's Creed has been in ages and remains fun to play for the entire game, it makes Yasuke's samurai gameplay feel subpar in comparison.Naoe feels like the intended protagonist of Shadows. Save for a brief hour as Yasuke, the first 12 or so hours are spent solely playing as the shinobi. Even once Yasuke returns to the story, it's in service to Naoe's goal to kill a dozen masked individuals and steal back a mysterious box that she has to recover.But even ignoring his narrative shortcomings as a secondary protagonist, Yasuke is not fun to play. Assassin's Creed has never been a series where its individual gameplay components have surpassed those in other games. Its combat has never been as good as what's available in other action games, other titles have stronger parkour mechanics, and the series always feels a step behind when it comes to stealth. The best part about Assassin's Creed has always been that it brings those three styles of gameplay together in one cohesive package--a combination you don't often see at the level of quality Ubisoft has managed to achieve with Assassin's Creed. Naoe perfectly embodies that trifecta, even possessing new mechanics that make the stealth part of Assassin's Creed a lot better than recent entries. Yasuke, on the other hand, doesn't. Though he's able to fight, Yasuke cannot use parkour, nor can he really rely on stealth. He's only one-third of Assassin's Creed. Although the idea of making an Assassin's Creed protagonist who solely specializes in open warfare sounds cool, in practice it feels awful because that aspect of the franchise is still not up to snuff with dedicated action games.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Apple restricts Pebble from being awesome with iPhones</title><link>https://ericmigi.com/blog/apple-restricts-pebble-from-being-awesome-with-iphones/</link><author>griffinli</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 16:23:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[During Pebble v1, I learned how much harder it is to build a great smartwatch experience on iPhone than it is on Android. It sounds like things have actually gotten worse over the last 8 years. I want to set expectations accordingly. We will build a good app for iOS, but be prepared - there is no way for us to support all the functionality that Apple Watch has access to. It’s impossible for a 3rd party smartwatch to send text messages, or perform actions on notifications (like dismissing, muting, replying) and many, many other things.Here are the things that are harder or impossible for 3rd party smartwatches (ie non Apple Watches) to do on iPhone:There’s no way for a smartwatch to send text messages or iMessages.You can’t reply to notifications or take ‘actions’ like marking something as done.It’s very difficult to enable other iOS apps to work with Pebble. Basically iOS does not have the concept of ‘interprocess communication’(IPC) like on Android. What we did before was publish an SDK that other apps (like Strava) could integrate to make their own BLE connection to Pebble. It was a clunky quasi-solution that other apps didn’t like, because it was hard to test (among other things)If you (accidentally) close our iOS app, then your watch can’t talk to app or internetImpossible for watch to detect if you are using your phone, so your watch will buzz and display a notification even if you are staring at your iPhoneYou can’t easily side load apps onto an iPhone. That means we have to publish the app on the iPhone appstore. This is a gigantic pain because Apple. Every update comes with the risk that a random app reviewer could make up some BS excuse and block the update.Because of iOS Appstore rules, it would be hard for us to enable 3rd party watchface/app developers to charge for their work (ie we can’t easily make an appstore within our app)Getting a Javascript engine to run in PebbleOS forced us to go through many hoops due to iOS — creating a compiler inside the Pebble iPhone app that in itself needed to be written in (cross-compiled to) JS to work with Apple's restriction on downloadable code can only be JSAs a Pebble watch/app developer, using the iOS app as relay to the watch sucks since the "developer mode" terminates every few minutesAs an aside, back at Pebble, we went to crazy lengths to find a way to let Pebble users to send text messages from Pebble. Our bizdev team did an impressive custom SMS-over-IP deal with AT&T to enable this, but the end result was a pretty rough user experience (messages sent from Pebble didn’t appear in the Messages app on iPhone). - it sounds like the situation has actually . This 2024 class action lawsuit against Apple states that: You must set notifications to display full content previews on your lockscreen for them to also be sent to a 3rd party watch (new restriction added in iOS 13).Apple closed off the ability of smartwatches after Pebble to negotiate with carriers to
provide messaging services, and now requires users to turn off iMessage (disabling iOS’s core messaging platform) if they want to take advantage of such contracts between a third-party smartwatch maker and cellular carriers.Why are things so much harder on iOS?Well, mostly because Apple systematically makes it nearly impossible for 3rd party wearable developers to build a smartwatch experience comparable to Apple Watch experience.Apple claims their restrictions on competitors are only about security, privacy, crafting a better experience etc etc. At least that’s what they tell you as they tuck you into bed. I personally don’t agree - they’re clearly using their market power to lock consumers into their walled ecosystem. This causes there to be less competition, which increases prices and reduces innovation. DOJ seems to agree. For now at least…Tim Apple paid $1m to sit near Trump at the inauguration, so who knows how long until Trump tells DOJ to drop the case. There’s also an Apple Watch class-action lawsuit working its way through the system.But we’re going to try anywaysThe problem is that 40% of everyone who signed up on rePebble.com still uses an iPhone. So we’re going to make a damn iOS app. I guess we’re gluttons for punishment. Just understand a few things:Our watch will  appear to have less developed functionality on iOS than Android. This is Apple’s fault, not ours.Some features will appear first on our Android app, and then eventually we’ll add them to the iOS app. This is because the majority of our development team uses Android phones, and generally we’re building things for ourselves, so naturally Android comes first.I don’t want to see any tweets or blog posts or complaints or whatever later on about this. I’m publishing this now so you can make an informed decision about whether to buy a new watch or not. If you’re worried about this, the easiest solution is to .Apple will never change their ways unless you, the Pebble-curious iPhone user, complain loudly or switch to Android. Which is also hard because Apple tries it’s best to lock you into their platform.Are you an iPhone user who wants to use our watches? Start by posting a comment below this post. Hopefully there will be a lot - let’s show them that people actually want this to improve.If you live in the US, tell your elected representatives to support legislation like ACCESS Act and AICO.If you live in Europe, thank you for voting for representatives who passed the DMA. We will be petitioning Apple under DMA Article 6 to request interoperability with Apple Watch APIs. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Answering Questions About Infinity, The Multiverse, &amp; Supercolliders</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ-eTuNY_b4</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/tQ-eTuNY_b4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 15:59:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What does it really mean for us to be made of stardust?

How might scientific breakthroughs have been different if the collider had been completed? Neil explains how the cancellation shifted the epicenter of particle physics to Europe and what that meant for the discovery of the Higgs boson.

From there, they explore the big questions: What existed before the Big Bang? Could we ever accelerate time to visit the past? We explore the multiverse, time dilation, and the poetic nature of scientific inquiry. Along the way, they discuss how science poses better questions rather than always finding answers, with nods to Isaac Newton and Star Trek’s influence on popular culture.

Are we made of stardust? Neil breaks down the cosmic origins of the elements in our bodies and what the future of human evolution might hold. Plus, they confront the mind-bending concept of infinity and whether there’s any evidence of parallel universes.

Prices are in USD. Pre-ordering is the only way to get one - they will not be sold in stores. Pre-order today at store.rePebble.com!Why are we making new Pebble-like smartwatches?Pretty simple - because we want one! No company has made a perfect smartwatch for people like us, so we’re going to make the exact smartwatch we want. Read the full story on my blog, but it comes down to 5 key features:Simple and beautiful designNo smartwatch on the market since Pebble offers this combination of features…until today!I think you might recognize this one 😉 It’s almost exactly a Pebble 2, upgraded with modern chips and new tricks. Duo is short for ‘Do-over’.Similar to Pebble 2, it featuresUltra crisp 1.26” black and white e-paper displayRuns 10,000+ Pebble apps and watchfacesLightweight polycarbonate frame in two colour options - White or BlackWater resistant (targeting IPX8)30 day battery life (up from 7)Linear resonance actuator (quieter and stronger than vibrating motor)More reliable buttons (up to 30% longer lifetime in testing)Barometer and compass sensorsSince this watch will look and feel just like a Pebble 2, you can refamiliarize yourself with it via videos, or reviews. For people interested in hacking on PebbleOS firmware, we’re offering an optional JTAG connector. I recommend buying 2 units if you want to hack, just in case!This is my dream watch. It’s everything Pebble Time 2 was going to be and more! 64-colour 1.5” e-paper display. Same display as Pebble Time 2 - much more room for text and details (53% bigger and 88% more pixels)Runs 10,000+ Pebble apps and watchfacesMetal frame and buttons (Black/White and likely a 3rd colour option as well)30 day battery life (estimate)Flat glass lens (less glare and reflections than Pebble Time family curved lens)Water resistant (targeting IPX8)Linear resonance actuator (vibrator)Standard 22mm watch strapThe industrial design is closely based on Pebble 2, which I really love. It’s slightly bigger to accommodate the larger display. Both the frame and buttons are made of metal (most likely CNC milled aluminum). More details, including final colour options, will be shared later this year. Left: Core 2 Duo - Right: Core Time 26-axis IMU, compass, barometerLinear resonance actuator (vibrator)Heart rate, step and sleep trackingEach watch runs open source PebbleOS. This enables all the baseline Pebble features like receiving notifications, timeline, watchfaces, alarms, timers, calendar, music control, basic fitness tracking, etc. The really fun part is that most of the existing 10,000+ PebbleOS watchfaces and apps will immediately work on these new watches, though some may try to access web services that no longer exist. Browse the full appstore on apps.rebble.io.Existing apps/faces will show up with a border on Core Time 2 until developers update them, since it has a larger display (200x228 vs 144x168 pixels). Read more about on the old Pebble dev blog.We will publish a companion mobile app for Android and iOS. My friend and past Pebble colleague, Steve, recently joined us to lead this effort. He’s joining crc32, long-time Cobble developer, who has been working with me since last summer. We’ll also be working on an updated SDK for creating new PebbleOS watchfaces or apps.These watches will be sold exclusively through store.rePebble.com. Due to limited supply of display inventory, both watches will be manufactured in limited quantities. I highly recommend placing a pre-order - we will be manufacturing fewer watches than the number of people who have signed up on rePebble already! A pre-order secures your watch but gives you flexibility if you change your mind - you can get a refund at any time up until your watch ships. Left: Core 2 Duo running PebbleOS - Right: Engineering samplesSchedule-wise,  is quite far along. We’ve already produced dozens of Core 2 Duo watches for testing and development. We’ve tested and confirmed our button improvements. PebbleOS has been compiled for the new architecture and runs on the watch. All firmware development is open source - you can follow the fun on Github and Discord. Our current schedule calls for shipments to begin in July. How are we so far along, given that PebbleOS was only open-sourced in January? Two things helped: a) I took a monetary risk and began product development a bit earlier 😉, and b) we found a supplier who still had inventory of some Pebble 2 components. Core Time 2 display lighting up! For , we’ve finished component selection, initial industrial and mechanical design, and found sources for long lead time components. Now, we’re in the middle of creating the first prototypes. The grand irony of hardware development is that software development is usually the slowest part of the project. Not this time! We’re extraordinarily thankful to Google for open sourcing PebbleOS, which gave us a massive boost.We’ll share more details (like Core Time 2 frame colour options) later this year, as we get closer to mass production. Our current schedule shows shipments beginning in December. Follow along on this blog, via email, on Bluesky or Twitter.Why were these specific specifications selected?Building a smartwatch is an exhausting (😂) exercise of constraint maximization. Think of it as linear algebra - we’re solving multiple equations with multiple unknown variables. The primary constraint is display selection. This choice governs the size and shape of the physical design, as well as being the component with the most power drain and biggest cost. Other variables are Bluetooth chip (governs: cost, software compatibility, engineering time), factory selection (cost, quality, speed, risk), sensors (power, cost, software), battery (size, battery life, cost) and more!Despite what Pebble’s second Kickstarter branding proclaimed, solving this inherently requires compromise. It’s a fine line to walk and generally the data is not 100% known upfront, so it inevitably requires some degree of trusting your gut. : we’re adding a touchscreen to Core Time 2. Why? Very specifically, I want to add the concept of ‘complications’ to watchfaces and widgets. Like on Apple Watch, these complications/widgets will show glanceable information like weather, next calendar event, step count, etc. The touch screen adds the ability to tap on the complication and directly open the associated app. This is much faster to use than opening an app via the button menu, and saves your quick launch (long-press on the buttons) for other apps. The touchscreen may be used for other interactions, like swiping to rapidly scroll down a list, but that will be lower priority. Core Time 2 will be the first PebbleOS watch to ship with a touchscreen, but not the first that we designed! In 2015, Pebble designed it into a watch called Cutts (or C2) and did some (very) preliminary software development work to integrate a touchscreen into PebbleOS.: I’m really excited that battery life will be increased from 7 days to 1 month! This is due to massive improvements in Bluetooth chip power efficiency over the last 10 years. : we’re adding this primarily for potential use in apps that benefit from audio output, like a ChatGPT or other AI agent app. It can’t easily be used for making voice calls, since the watches will not support Bluetooth Classic (required for headset profiles), but theoretically someone could write a custom voice calling client (eg SIP or something).: neither watch will support smartstraps. Sorry. Most people don’t even remember this feature even existed, which is kinda the answer to why it will not be supported. RIP.You shouldn’t get one if…You need a perfectly polished smartwatch. This project is a labour of love rather than a startup trying to sell millions of watches. There may be some rough edges (literally). Things will get delayed. Some features will not be ready at launch. Things could break. Things could not last as long as you’d like. The only thing we can guarantee is that it will be awesome and a lot of fun! Every time you look down at your watch, you will smile 🙂You’re looking for a fitness or sports watch. That’s not what we’re making. From what we hear, Garmin watches are great for runners/cyclists/triathletes!   You’re comparing this to an Apple Watch. There is NO way for a 3rd party smartwatch to compete with Apple Watch. Apple restricts 3rd parties in major ways - read my blog post for more information. For example, 3rd party watches on iOS cannot send replies to notifications.   These watches are not made for everyone. We want to be upfront with you about what to expect. Watch images above feature impeccably designed watchfaces from TTMM, including one of my all-time favourites - TTMMBRN. Thank you Albert!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From Rules to Reasoning Engines // George Mathew // #296</title><link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/mlops/episodes/From-Rules-to-Reasoning-Engines--George-Mathew--296-e30b6ik</link><author>Demetrios</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/100030484/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-2-18%2F396796611-44100-2-7e9ea54af5997.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 15:19:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://mlops.community/">Podcast - MLOps</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[From Rules to Reasoning Engines // MLOps Podcast #297 with George Mathew, Managing Director at Insight Partners.Join the Community: https://go.mlops.community/YTJoinIn Get the newsletter: https://go.mlops.community/YTNewsletter // AbstractGeorge Mathew (Insight Partners) joins Demetrios to break down how AI and ML have evolved over the past few years and where they’re headed.

--

Humans have been transforming seawater into potable freshwater for millennia. Today, billions of people can’t access clean drinking water, and 87 different countries are projected to be “water-scarce” by 2050. So, how can we use seawater desalination to combat water scarcity? And can we do it without further harming the environment? Manish Kumar digs into how scientists are creating freshwater.

Reality is not real. Your world is a prediction. Every sight, sound, and touch you experience is the result of calculations your brain makes before reality even reaches you. It fills in gaps, fabricates details, and even alters time itself so you feel like you’re in control. But if everything you know is an illusion… what does that say about you? What does it mean for your choices? Is there even free will?

"You can just talk to the large language models and they will code entire apps," Tan told CNBC (video). "You don't have to hire someone to do it, you just talk directly to the large language model that wrote it and it'll fix it for you." What would've once taken "50 or 100" engineers to build, he believes can now be accomplished by a team of 10, "when they are fully vibe coders." He adds: "When they are actually really, really good at using the cutting edge tools for code gen today, like Cursor or Windsurf, they will literally do the work of 10 or 100 engineers in the course of a single day." 

According to Tan, 81% of Y Combinator's current startup batch consists of AI companies, with 25% having 95% of their code written by large language models. Despite limitations in debugging capabilities, Tan said the technology enables small teams to perform work previously requiring dozens of engineers and makes previously overlooked niche markets viable for software businesses.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Is Frontex enabling illegal pushbacks? | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ46WQFO-4Q</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/BJ46WQFO-4Q?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 14:00:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Frontex is the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, established in 2004 to assist EU member states in managing and securing external borders.

DESCRIPTION
This conversation between Duncan McGregor and Nat Pryce explores the legacy of Nat's co-authored book "Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests" (GOOS) and how software development practices have evolved in the past 15 years.

They discuss the origins of test-driven development (TDD) within London's Extreme Tuesday Club, the shift from object-oriented to functional programming paradigms, and how changing technology has influenced development approaches.

Key topics include outside-in vs bottom-up testing strategies, mock objects, the rise of microservices, and whether modern development practices have actually improved productivity.
The conversation provides valuable historical context for understanding current software development trends while questioning whether some modern practices represent true progress.

From there, I can read the Protocol Buffer data Google uses to populate YouTube with ads. It is too CPU-intensive to decode Protobuf on the fly, so instead, I found a flaw in the Protobuf format which allows me to reliably change one byte to obliterate ads.What follows is a reference guide for setting up a bare-metal network router to block malicious ads, obnoxious ads, tracking, clickbait, crypto-jackers, scam popups, Windows spying on you, etc. using blocklists to protect all networked devices. Let’s build a cryptographically-strong router with FreeBSD and pfSense to completely block YouTube ads using a flaw in the Google Protocol Buffer format to completely block pre-roll, mid-roll, and end-roll YouTube ads on Apple TV and iPhones, network-wide. I want to support content creators, so to be fair, after a few months of blocking YouTube ads, I am now paying for YouTube Premium; Just because I can break something, doesn’t mean I need to.Part 1 – Setup pfSense on Bare-MetalPart 2 – Isolate Network LANsPart 3 – Setup DNS AdblockingPart 4 – Trick the YouTube Ad AlgorithmPart 5 – Decrypt HTTPS TrafficPart 6 – Intercept Apple TV and iOS YouTube AdsPart 7 – Reverse-Engineer Protobuf MessagesWhy block Malicious Ads and Behaviour Tracking?You are a valuable commodity that is bought and sold without your knowledge or consent. You will be tricked with clickbait, distracted with large ads, and enticed to leave the site you are on at every opportunity. Plus, everything you do online is being monitored so your habits and searches can be remarketed and sold over and over again for years. – Knowing what you like to watch and read, what phone you have, what you watch on Netflix, what you shop for, what you ask Alexa about, yout taste in music, etc. is  valuable to advertisers. Spying on people is such a big problem that Europe passed the GDPR law so every site you visit asks if you are okay with cookies (and we blindly click “ok” to hide the banner). We must wrestle back privacy ourselves. – If privacy doesn’t concern you, how about this: it is well-known that between 25% and 40% of network traffic is ads, tracking, JavaScript to load trackers (fingerprint.js, googletagmanager.js), websocket traffic to collect how you scroll and what you type (Hotjar), and the like. Do you have a 100 Mbps internet connection? Consider it 60 Mbps! – Then there is clickbait. “You won’t believe what Tom Cruise did. He…” and you may want to click. Then you are in the spider’s web. How about fake news? Or articles that don’t say “sponsored” in size-8 font, but now say “underscored” to be clever. What is even real anymore? As soon as you click on clickbait, you may end up on a page with a dozen more ads that aren’t approved by Google but lead to a dark world of maliciousness. Clickbait is so incredibly profitable to scammers. – Some websites will load crypto-mining JavaScript (e.g. CoinHive.js) so while you read, they overheat and abuse your computer to try to make a few pennies. Some sites will load JavaScript that tries to steal from your crypto wallet or trick you into transferring cryptocurrency. It is highly lucrative yet detrimental to you to track and trick you, and only  can do something about it.A virtual machine, Docker image, or Raspberry Pi are not performant enough to protect a whole SMB network; We need dedicated hardware with a cryptographic instruction set so that its only function is to route, decrypt, and monitor packets in and out. Here is what I used.A mini PC with the AES-NI instruction set (e.g. J4125)Several gigabytes of DDR4 RAM (e.g. 32 GiB)A decent mSATA SSD drive (e.g. 128 GiB)A USB drive to transfer pfSenseI’ve ordered a mini J4125 PC from AliExpress, ordered 32 GB of DDR4 RAM and a 128 GB mSATA from Amazon, and will assemble them for the first time now. Out of caution, I searched diligently for a barebones mini PC that did not include RAM or an SSD; there is nothing stopping an overseas seller from including some generic RAM and SSD but charging Samsung prices. 128 GB of disk space on a router? Yup. That should be plenty of space to hold logs and not wear down the SSD too quickly,  to allow beautiful packet capture (and maybe an edge cache for NPM and Docker?).A beautiful box, isn’t it? It only has 3 LAN ports, but it can be extended with network switches.Install pfSense on Bare MetalI’ve never used pfSense before, so we will explore this together. The compressed image is about 360 MB and can be flashed to a USB drive with an AppImage binary of Etcher (very cool). Decisions, decisions: VGA install or serial? Let’s serial into the new router. Why not?Well, that looks painful. It would also be a whole production to serial into the box in case of an emergency because the serial port is inside, and there isn’t even an RS232 or JTAG connector – just some narrow header pins. Yikes. Let’s go with VGA and plug a keyboard into the USB port – get ready to navigate with arrows and tabs.I’ll follow this guide on YouTube. I’ll pass on encrypting the disk since I would like to avoid entering a passphrase each time the mini PC reboots. A stripe disk is fine since there is only one disk. I have no idea what to expect yet, so I will pass on dropping to a shell for a more advanced configuration.I ejected the USB containing the boot image (important) and rebooted the little box. It played a melody on the internal speaker (there is an internal buzzer and thankfully it isn’t very loud).Do I need to have a LAN connection already, or can I just start the thing? I’ll just start pfSense and let it complain to me if it wants… and according to the YouTube tutorial, I should guess which port is LAN 1. I’ll do that now.I figured out that I should set the LAN 1 to a static IP address that is not in my existing router’s DHCP range, so I went with . Now I can access an admin web portal (/). Hooray.Yikes, the mini PC beeped at me and informed me that ‘admin’ has logged in. That startled me a bit, but hey that is pretty neat.Enable the AES-NI Cryptographic InstructionI played around with the wizard, used defaults, and got to the web configurator. The first thing that caught my eye was AES-NI CPU Crypto: Yes (inactive). I went out of my way to get a mini PC with AES-NI. What gives?Ah, this needs to be enabled in System > Advanced > Miscellaneous. Why not auto-detect this and use the best option? I’m glad I spotted that, or else this mini PC might as well be a Celeron J1900 of yesteryear.Having 32 GiB of RAM, let’s take advantage of that and use a generous amount of RAM for  and , and since hopefully this 128 GiB SSD has wear levelling, let’s take a RAM Disk backup every hour.Reboot!  is now active.This dashboard is pretty slick. I’m just discovering that there are widgets that can be added to the Dashboard, including S.M.A.R.T to alert us if the SSD is going bad. Nice.Hang on, when I added the Services Status widget, something called  shows up. What is that? Research shows it’s a daemon for hardware smart keys that we can probably do without(?). It can be disabled in the  file like so:Wait. After some time went by, I noticed the router slowed down, fatally. Do NOT try to disable the Smart Card Service as it is needed by IPsec; if you start experimenting with an IPsec VPN tunnel and the  daemon is disabled, then your hard disk will fill up with logs and your CPU will run hot.Adblocking with pfBlockerNGThis unboxing and setup has been fun, but I’d like to block all the bad traffic on my network. I’ve been using a workhorse of a DNS-level adblocker called Pi-Hole on a… yes, Pi, but it would be nice if I can reclaim that wee bit of hardware for something else and use a comparable add-on module in pfSense. Let’s explore that now.pfBlockerNG is a very powerful package for pfSense® which provides advertisement and malicious content blocking along with geo-blocking capabilities.Question: Do I install the first  or the  which feels like a developer version? I’m a software developer, so this is for me, but am I a pfSense developer? No. Maybe it will show me advanced logs or I can mess about with LUA? Let’s Google this.From here, random people are saying to install the development version. Another blogger advocates using the dev version as well. Meh, I guess we can install , , and Python 3.8. This doesn’t  like a development version since it has exciting dependencies.That was painless and only added an extra 20 MiB. It seems a lot of the dependencies are part of pfSense already. The knight at the end of Raiders would say that I have chosen wisely (hey, why did Indy age like a normal person up to Indy 4 if he drank the immortality water that the thousand-year-old knight also drank?).There are a lot of options in step three. This is not like Pi-hole at all. I’m going to come back to this and set up my network instead so I accomplish retiring my Nighthawk R700 or giving it new life as a Wi-Fi AP. If the  service won’t start or the status tab states , try deleting the empty file  (ref).Isolate LANs for SecurityAn opportunity has presented itself: I can create real networks on each of the three router Gigabit ports (not VLANs), and should I do so? Yes, yes I should. I would like a dedicated hardware network for all my home-phoning spy devices (Alexas and Apple TV) so they don’t flood my network with metrics info and “sure I’m muted and not listening to you” audio payloads back to their HQs.I can see it now: A Wi-Fi AP on a hardware LAN that is isolated from everything else and dedicated to these gadgets,  runs through the adblocker  traps hard-coded DNS queries to  and  and others (I’ll have to explore this) so YouTube on my TV doesn’t sneakily bypass  any DNS-level blocker. It’s so Utopian an outcome I may not be able to sleep.I’ve decided that my bottom-shelf TP-Link wireless router that is so old that  might as well be “A.D. 1200” is going to be my Wi-Fi AP for those IoT spy devices.In sum, there will be a dedicated hardware LANwith a wireless AP (AC1200) for Amazon/Apple gadgets and the TV.with a wired switch for all the beefy computers and clusters in my lab.with another wireless AP (R7000) just for iPhones and watches.As an aside, since doing an Offensive Security hacking course in my spare time, and I rare-earth-magnet-strongly suggest isolating Wi-Fi devices from any critical LAN segments connected to devices that touch daily banking or stock trading (or crypto wallets).Class B IPv4 172.31.1.0/24 Network for Untrusted DevicesThe class B IPv4 range 172.16/16 is a valid range of private IP addresses. I’m not uncomfortable with Alexa and Apple TV being even on the same class network as my main LAN segment, so I will banish them to the class B private network at the hardware level, and my more trusted LANs will be on the traditional class C network (192.168/16). This helps mitigate any misconfigured  rules by naturally having no routes between the two networks.Be sure to enable the DHCP resolver on the physical NIC that will connect smart devices (which mainly just tell me the weather and creepily listen to me sleep).From this point, DHCP works on this new network, but by default, it assigns IP addresses but does  routing. All traffic is blocked by default.We need to manually add rules so traffic on the physical NICs goe somewhere.There is a logging message. Let me reproduce it below.Hint: the firewall has limited local log space. Don’t turn on logging for everything.I read that to mean, “Congratulations on not cheaping out on your SSD. Now go forth and log everything, my son.”I’m not a new-age, fancy-jazz, coloured-light- or smart-plug-controlling guy who forgot how to turn on a light without his phone, so I do not need to have smart devices on the same network as my phone (why create dozens of wireless attack vectors into your home?). I’m classicly trained to actuate an electromechanical current interrupter on the wall and light let there be.Setup the Untrusted Wi-Fi APHow do I reach the admin UI of AC1200 Wi-Fi AP now? I factory reset it, plugged the WAN NIC into the ETH3 NIC of the pfSense router, but both devices are just blinking at me.I suppose I can just Wi-Fi into the factory-reset AC1200. Yikes, 2016 was a bad year for responsive web UIs I take it. This is horrible; I’ll pull out a netbook for this. One sec.It seems the Archer C5 has no AP Mode. This is my problem, not yours, but I’m still going to vent.Oh, and the “refresh” icon on the top of the DCHP Leases page in pfSense is not “refresh”, but “reload service”. Whoops.Well, I bricked the AC1200 router. I will have to run an Ethernet cable manually… but, wait, my thin notebook has no Ethernet ports and needs a USB-NIC adapter. Happy Friday. Connect LAN to LAN, not the AP’s WAN to pfSense’s LAN unless you want to do double NATing.There were shenanigans, but I set the LAN IP of the AC1200 to , the ETH3 NIC IP of the pfSense router to , and set the pfSense DHCP service on ETH3 to assign addresses . What  was setting the AC1200 to  as it was unreachable (reason unknown). Oh yes, I had to turn off firewally things and , and basically drop the horsepower of this TP-Link router down to that of a potato battery. The above settings allow me to access the AC1200 remotely now.The other video ran its course, so I started following this YouTube video (set the speed to 1.5x).One more thing: I installed the  package for pfSense and scanned the AC1200 router, and found some sneaky ports open.Port  is a print server port that I’ve now closed. However, the Archer C5 AC1200 is vulnerable to all kinds of Kali mischief so it was wise to put it on its own network. I’m not sure how to close port 22 and the  service on it the AC1200 because the stock firmware is ancient and crippled, so I’ll just have to block port 22 on the whole LAN segment.I’ve also taken care of disallowing private networks to ingress on the WAN (see the next section to set up DMZ).Unable to Reach 172.31.1.x from 192.168.10.xPing and Traceroute are aiding me in my efforts to connect to the AC1200 Wi-Fi AP from my  LAN. I went ahead and added the subnet to the Symantec Firewall rules just in case (Symantec has its place now and then, but yes, definitely have available PC CPU horsepower to spare).Now, it seems ICMP packets are no longer blocked between networks, but I still cannot ping the AP web management UI even though I can see the pings in the traffic logs.I’ve even added an “any to any” firewall rule on the Untrusted network. No change.Let’s try a stealth scan instead: sudo nmap -sS -v 172.31.1.*.Nope, pfSense doesn’t like that at all. And, the whole network stopped working. Nice security! Also, dang.The good news is that I’ve isolated the packet malaise to the TP-Link AC1200 box itself. I suspect that I need to add  to forward packets with no addresses in them, but I’d need root access to the AC1200. Let’s burn it to the ground and rebuild from its sprinkler-soaked ashes.Replace Stock Firmware on the AC1200 Wi-Fi Access PointOf course, I cannot actually stop Untrusted LAN devices from reaching the AC1200 as they all exist downstream from the pfSense box.DD-WRT open-source router firmware, meet my ancient Archer C5 and do your thing.The Archer C5 did not accept the DD-WRT firmware. Hmm… how about OpenWRT?The Archer C5 did not accept the OpenWRT firmware either. What the actual facepalm (WTAF)? My hardware is revision 2 using the Broadcom chipsets which are notoriously difficult networking chips. Devices with Broadcom Wi-Fi chipsets have limited OpenWrt supportability (due to limited FLOSS driver availability for Broadcom chips). (REF: OpenWRT.org)Alright, so OpenWRT, DD-WRT, and Tomato projects have no firmware for this AC1200 with unpopular Broadcom chipsets. Into the refuse bin it goes.Archer C5 v2 into the Refuse Bin, R7000 as the New Wi-Fi API’ve dismantled the AC1200 so I do not forget why I threw it out. It’s too bad because it’s so pretty on the inside, and they always say, “It is what is inside that counts… except if you are a router with Broadcom chips.”The R7000 is factory reset, and here is the first problem: On factory reset, the Nighthawk R7000 is pretty uptight about the format of the password. One rule is that no more than two identical consecutive characters are allowed. Well, thanks Netgear for pretty much providing a Regex to password crackers. Let’s disable all those rules with a few keystrokes to delete the JavaScript “blocking” the form submission. Now my admin password does not conform to the Regex and is super long. Muhahaha to Netgear password crackers.The R7000 is in AP mode, but I can still access the pfSense web management page from the Untrusted network. Let’s lock down the web UI in pfSense under Firewall Rules.Set up the Trusted Wireless NetworkThe Untrusted network is now looking good. It’s time to make the  R7000 Nighthawk I have into a Wi-Fi AP as well so my phone and watch have a safe place to connect to, as well as a laptop when I want to RDP into my wired machines from the kitchen. I was saving that for a honeypot AP, but I can come back to that later.Let’s see if I can Wi-Fi into the Wireless LAN’s R7000… Remember to physically unplug the pfSense upstream router from the R7000 because the R7000 is too helpful and will enter into AP mode by sensing any upstream routers, then you cannot get into the web UI anymore.Since only my trusted devices should be on the Wireless LAN, I’ll turn off 2.4 GHz wi-fi because anything recent and wireless should support 5 GHz. That means those pesky AliExpress Pineapple wi-fi password stealers on the cheap side only use 2.4 GHz, so a neighbour is going to have to put in some effort to snoop on my network. Plus, 5 GHz is blocked more easily by walls and concrete, so I prefer it for averting medium-range snooping. But, I so am going to set up a honeypot and to brake check my faith in humanity.It is normally straightforward to put a Wi-Fi router into AP mode by disabling WAN and DHCP.Network Devices Interconnectivity CheckDo all my dozens of computers, laptops, Pis, clusters, NAS drives, and the like still connect as before? Most important is my web-scraping bot in a hardened, RAIDed, dedicated machine with its own UPS. But alas, I cannot SSH into it even though the SSH handshake packets make it to the hefty box.Could this be our old frienemy IPv4 forwarding being disabled? Possibly. I’m able to SSH into the machine from my iPhone (seriously) when on the same network.Nope. Adding  in the right place with a restart did not yield joy.According to  (to tail  logs), UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) is not blocking ICMP requests or TCP requests on port 22. When I do something nutty like try to SSH on, say, port 23, then I can see the UFW block logs in . Confirmed: Packets can reach that machine.Running tcpdump src 192.168.10.100 where the IP is from the Trusted network on the target machine shows it  responding to pings. I’m even getting replies to SSH handshake requests. So now we know that  packets are being dropped. Interesting! Aside:  is awesome.Let’s follow the trail. Digging a little deeper I see replies to ICMP and SSH handshakes are being sent to some IP over HTTPS that I do not recognize. Bizzare. When I run the usual  tools I see that replies are going over a VPN that I completely forgot about. Ha. Replies to a different subnet are egressing over the VPN, but cannot return properly. Neat.Now that I remember what I did in 2019, I re-added NAT alias rules, and it’s showtime again.Windows File Sharing GotchasYour path may be smoother, but I’ve always seem to make the Trench Run instead of remote-piloting a handful of lead-filled X-Wings at light speed right  the Death Star’s reactor to make it go boom: the easy way.I’ve added some rules to allow Static DHCP devices to talk to each other – Windows devices – but by default, the Private Network in the Windows Defender uses the local subnet as the rule scope. That means different subnets are isolated. We can’t just relax the pfSense DHCP subnet mask to say  because it conflicts with another subnet. Instead, just to get file sharing working, I relax the  in Advanced Settings like below. Be sure to modify In and Out for SMB and ICMP.Again, please add whatever subnets you desire instead of .Public Service Announcement: Edge BrowserWhy does the Microsoft Edge browser start automatically and run in the background, and why can’t I kill it when I ? If you’ve asked yourself this, you’re not alone. It turns out Edge starts up when you log in and it keeps running in the background. Here is the fix:I suggest downloading Winaero Tweaker and applying registry tweaks to cut down on the Redmond Spy Machine.Block Clickbait, Endless Ads, and Dangerous SitesThanks to web-browser and DNS-level adblockers (i.e. Pi-hole), it’s commonplace to block bad sites, crypto-miners, fingerprinters, trackers, remarketers, banners, pop-ups, fake tech-support scam alerts, and all manner of unscrupulousness designed to take advantage of you. Let’s take pfBlockerNG on pfSense for spin. If you have multiple network interfaces (the mini PC has four), then you need to enable the Permit Firewall Rules for multiple interfaces and select them.Would you like to have discretion over blocklists? Let’s add a DNS blocklist related to gambling and reload pfBlockerNG to see if a poker site is blocked on the Trusted LAN.If you would prefer the connection to just close instead of rendering a PHP page, create a new PHP script with the following code and select it in the pfBlockerNG settings page:Intercept All DNS Requests, Even to Hardcoded DNS ServersLet’s make sure all clients behind the pfSense router use the local Unbound DNS server so pfBlockerNG can act on them. We do not want apps and home assistants to bypass our DNS server, so we have to add some NAT rules.First, we have to block DNS over TLS (for now) and only allow local DNS requests (note the rule order):Here is a NAT rule for one interface. I started by making a rule for each interface except WAN (obviously) like this below. NAT reflection should be disabled so the wild Internet cannot access our DNS server.To make life simpler, I made a firewall alias of all non-WAN interfaces called . Covering IPv4 and IPV6 to redirect local DNS queries on port 53 to localhost are the following redirect rules:Let’s also log trapped DNS requests. Head to the  page, click “Display Custom Options”, and add the lines:Well, hello there, Microsoft Windows. What are you up to trying to reach Google Tag Manager? Naughty OS. That request is now black-holed to a non-existent IP at .Let’s turn our attention to the TV and see how it fares under DNS interception.How to Restrict Apple TV and iPhone YouTube Ads? Regarding YouTube, YouTube has been showing 7-second and 15-second ads, twice, back-to-back, nearly every few minutes. Why are the ads incessant and so long? I do not mind the occasional ad, similar to live TV, but these frequent ads would warrant FTC complaints it they were on live TV.YouTube is tricky because ads are also videos that come from the same domain, so domain-name blockers like pfBlockerNG cannot act on them. The best pfBlockerNG and Pi-hole can do is block  only after you watch an ad video and click on the ad.Many people opt to use a web browser like Firefox or Chrome with uBlock Origin that acts on JavaScript as a workaround. It might be enough to watch YouTube on a web browser and stream that to a smart TV. However, we cannot restrict ads on the iPhone (without jailbreaking and compromising it).What are our options? How can we safely restrict YouTube ads on all network devices?Trick the YouTube Ad Algorithm Instead Among friends, let’s say that English-speaking countries get ads for the most ridiculous things because their residents are assumed to have disposable income. Can we instead make YouTube think we are an undesirable advertising target?What do ads in other parts of the world look like? Are those living in Antarctica or Low Earth Orbit getting a lot of ads too?What would happen if we leverage the capabilities of this pfSense router to route YouTube Location Tracking information through a VPN that terminates in some remote part of the world with fewer YouTube viewers per capita? In other words, let’s make ourselves undesirable to advertisers and see if we get fewer ads.Research into YouTube Advertizing SpendLet’s also check some YouTube statistics about viewers by country for insights. Thinking about following some Reddit advice and VPN’ing into India? Think again.That was 2019. This is 2020:I’m not a digital advertiser, but I can see that people in the UK and Canada watch a large number of videos per sitting. If I  an advertiser though, I’d pump those two countries with video ad after video ad because, statistically, those residents will take the eyeball kicking. All things being equal, I definitely need a VPN to terminate outside of Canada, the UK, and the United States (English-speaking countries) to enjoy YouTube more.Does age play a factor? Who  advertisers want? I want to be that guy on paper. Let’s trick YouTube into believing I am a 70-year-old male living in Italy. Yes, that should definitely cut down on the Nespresso and Starbucks ads, at least.How then to convince YouTube that I am a retired Sicilian living on a small chain island? I embellished that last part. Seventy and in Italy is sufficient.Let’s do this. In the YouTube account…It is doubtful that this is all it takes for our goal. Let’s find a VPN exit point in Italy.Nice. NordVPN has about 60 servers in Italy (that’s an affiliate link by the way).Selectively Route Apple TV Over the VPNLet’s go through some tutorials to set up  in pfSense. Just kidding! We’re going to use WireGuard – we have the Intel AES-NI crypto instruction set because we didn’t go cheap and get a yesteryear J1900 mini PC that sellers are trying to offload.I’ll now install the FreeBSD WireGuard package.Next, add a tunnel and enable it. According to this thread and this thread on Reddit, we need to get some information for WireGuard and NordLynx from a sacrificial Linux VM to transpose the settings (i.e. private key) to the pfSense router. No problem.Run sudo wg showconf nordlynx to see your private key needed by the pfSense tunnel config.Here are various screenshots that show the steps in more detail. Enter  and then  as the subnet mask. Do not go for  as there is a glitch or bug in the UI or whathaveyou. The result will still be .That should be enough to allow Diagnostics to  Italy.Now that the easy part is out of the way, let’s set some Policy rules to send the Apple TV traffic over the VPN to Italy as a baseline test.Traffic from LAN to WAN is processed as described in the following more detailed example.Port forwards or 1:1 NAT on the LAN interface (e.g. proxy or DNS redirects)Firewall rules for the LAN interface:Floating rules inbound on LANRules for interface groups including the LAN interface1:1 NAT or Outbound NAT rules on WANFloating rules that match outbound on WANI’ll make an alias, for now, to hold some clients that have static DHCP entries and hostnames I gave them in pfSense.Floating rules  have high precedence, so I’ll add some rules below the automatic pfBlockerNG rules that were created, and I’ll add a nice little blue separator while I’m here.And here is that rule as a very long screenshot:Apply. Wait. Let’s try it out using one of my notebooks connected to the Untrusted network.Google is in Italian. Very cool. Now for the Apple TV.Winner winner, chicken diner. All my YouTube is in Italian. I get some ads, not as many, but because Italians speak slowly and with a kind of sexy accent I do not mind the ads for Nutella at all.With this technique, I no longer feel manipulated by non-English ads. I have personalized ads , but given my new status as a retired gentleman I should turn that back on to scare away advertising dollars, er, euros. I wonder if Netflix and Amazon Prime behave any differently…Dang. Netflix is having problems. Amazon Prime is even worse. It looks like some CSS or font files are blocked as well, and the thumbnails aren’t loading. It’s time to move to Phase Two: Tunnel only YouTube traffic over the VPN. Do not try to send all the Apple TV traffic over a VPN because Netflix, Prime, and others are wise to VPN providers and have gotten great at geofencing.Selectively Route Apple TV YouTube Traffic Over the VPNLet’s start by adding Firewall Policy rules to send the most common YouTube domains over the VPN.As I’m about to add the rules, my hands hover over the keyboard not knowing what domains to tunnel. They need to be FQDN (fully-qualified domain names, no wildcards). Let’s open up a Chromium-based browser and see what traffic it generates in DevTools.Here are some candidate FQDNs to add:But wait, I hear you ask, why  and ? This is a preventative measure just in case one of those domains is geo-jacked (Geo-IP LowJacking). I wouldn’t put it past Google engineers to geo-jack the fonts domains like , but I’ll take a chance they don’t in the interest of scaling to billions of page views efficiently.Here are my new rules where I chain two of them using a tag so I can limit YouTube tunnelling to only the same untrusted machines (including Apple TV).And with that, YouTube thinks I’m in Milan, Netflix and Prime Video think I am still in Canada, and the ads… oh the ads… they are few and far between, and when they do come on, they are just a treat to listen to in that slow, lack-of-harsh-aspirants-or-yelling of a beautiful language Italian is.Gotcha: DNS Race ConditionA day has gone by and I’ve noticed that I only get Nutella and Ferrero Roche ads in the middle of videos, not at the start. Odd. I did some research and this is what I found:This means that the hostnames are resolved to IP addresses  and those IPs are used in my VPN tunnelling policy rules.A hostname entry in a host or network type alias is periodically resolved and updated by the firewall every few minutes. The default interval is 300 seconds (5 minutes), and can be changed by adjusting the value of Aliases Hostnames Resolve Interval on System > Advanced, Firewall & NAT tab. – pfSenseAh-ha, so I suspect there is a DNS race condition. Let me explain:This happens if, say, the Alias Daemon updates the IPs of the FQDNs. Then, I turn on the Apple TV for the first time all day. Since the usual TTL (time-to-live) of DNS queries is 1440 seconds (30 minutes), all the YouTube DNS entries will be cache misses and will need to be updated. At this point, the IPs from the second DNS queries may be from a pool and are not guaranteed to be the same that the Alias Daemon has. When the Alias Daemon checks again in five minutes, it may resolve the FQDNs to yet different IPs!Let’s solve this by overwriting whatever TTL (time-to-live) YouTube has in its DNS entries:And with that, no more DNS lookup race condition.Gotcha: Authentication Trouble, Forbidden 403 ErrorSometimes videos will not play. For security, YouTube embeds your IP in the  request. I’ve known about this since my post about Download YouTube 4K Videos with PHP back in 2016. The new problem is that various JavaScript and “are you human?” assets are tunnelled over VPN, but those darn domains like r5---sn-hpa7kn76.googlevideo.com are not tunnelled and thus come from the wrong IP. Queue the  error.Let’s fail fast with a quick experiment: I’ve gotten the IP of the above second-level domain name (SLD), added it manually to the list of domains/IPs to VPN tunnel, applied the change, and refreshed YouTube:Excellent. Now, we just need a way to tunnel that wildcard  domain. Unfortunately, the NAT and Firewall rules work with IPs, not wildcard domain names. Can we predict or enumerate these domains?Here is a Wireshark capture of DNS requests to  to show that the SLDs (second-level domains) are not eyeballably predictable:Let’s drop into a web browser with adblocking disabled and walk the HAR waterfall of my interaction with YouTube that led to ads showing up.What are GET requests likeGET https://r7---sn-uxa0n-t8ge.googlevideo.com/generate_204doing, exactly? I’ll give this problem some thought offline.Gotcha: YouTube is Now Showing UK Ads, Not Italian AdsBefore I could even solve the previous gotcha, British ads started showing up with the same frequency as if we did nothing. Ads from the UK are even more incessant than those from Canada, trailing behind the USA and India according to my earlier stats. It would be a complete failure if we get UK ads. Why does this happen suddenly? I’ve opened a fresh browser in a VM and tunnelled all traffic through Italy. The only leak I can find is when I query  on my Italian tunnel and see a UK address in the ASN. Could this small leak be our undoing?Even with my browser’s language set to  and location data off, this is the only leak I can spot. Then, in addition to a VPN exiting in Italy, it has to be one that doesn’t leak  (Autonomous System Numbers – used for automated routing) that gives up a different country. Dang, Google, you’re good. I’m going to have to bring my A+ game to this one.Find a VPN Exit Node with no ASN LeakBy visiting https://nordvpn.com/servers/tools/, I can see the VPN endpoint nodes in Italy. There are many Wireguard endpoints with NordVPN. Just to move things forward for this exercise, I’ll add an OpenVPN tunnel in pfSense and connect to several VPN nodes and examine the ASNs. It’s better than nothing, and more importantly, I’d like to eliminate the  as the leak of GeoIP information. Here is the guide I used.Through trial and error, I found a VPN node that is registered to an ISP in Italy as found in the  and  info.Hijack Google Video DNS QueriesTo make any of this work, I need a technique to route the wildcard  domain through the VPN. Suppose I write a plugin for pfSense that periodically s the DNS query log, keeps track of the  queries, and adds them to a unique list of aliases for Google Video domains; if backed by an LRU eviction policy, this could keep working indefinitely. However, if each video uses a unique, mangled domain, then this does not work unless I hit refresh on every single video.On the other hand, if I “hold up” the DNS query for the  domains, add the IPs to some alias list,  allow the DNS response to finish the round trip, we may be in business!Where to even start? Here are some Python example scripts just to get some inspiration. A quick, mental reverse-engineering of a handful of scripts reveals that there are some event hooks available. Nice.Among friends, let’s say that I can build up the pool of Google video IPs in real-time. How then to add these IPs programmatically to the firewall alias list for YouTube  restarting the firewall? One person actually hacked the PHP scripts in pfSense. Tempting, but I’ll do more research. Another person created a REST API for pfSense. Jackpot! We need to add IPs to the firewall policy rule to route YouTube videos over a VPN to avoid incessant and obnoxious North-American ads, but the IPs keep changing due to changing, mangled second-level domain names (SLDs). Using Python 3 and a REST API, we will monitor the appropriate DNS queries, note the IP(s) of the response, hold the response, add the IP(s) to the VPN tunnelling policy rule, then release the DNS query response.Research Python Methods to Hijack DNS RequestsWhy this approach? It’s future-proof, modular, elegant, maintainable, automated, and it lends itself to a future decision tree that could truly restrict YouTube ads outright.First, I will enable SSHd in pfSense and take a peek around.Let’s take this opportunity to make a disk backup.  or “duh” shows that only 800 MiB is in use on the SSD. Let’s  the whole box from our local machine in about four minutes. To verify the owners and permissions are set in the extended attributes locally, rungetfattr -d -m ^ -R -- ~/.pfsense-backupNow that we have a pfSense backup (I’m told just backing up  works too), let’s install the REST API.This part had me confused. You see, I was looking at the bottom of the screen wondering how the heck I could copy a truncated hash as a token. After a few tries, I noticed the green message at the top that I had been trained to ignore. It has the token.Next, with the API credentials set up, let’s try out the API:Explore the Unbound Python ModuleRunning  shows that the current version of Python is 3.8.As for the Unbound DNS Resolver, I had some luck tinkering in  and writing simple Python 3.8 code to log DNS query messages. We now have both parts needed to dynamically update the firewall aliases and tunnel all YouTube traffic once and for all.If you are looking for Python module docs for Unbound, here they are:Run these commands to quickly get the documentation. The example code is from Python 2.4, so be prepared to run Black and PyCharm code formatting, or run . Also, the most important part of this whole exercise (getting the IPs from the DNS reply) is missing, so here is the hint: . Don’t forget to manually hack the byte strings to pull out the proper IP addresses in binary form, first.Now we have Python docs and access to all the capabilities. Excellent.Next, take a backup of your OS or VM and install  and  wherever, ./configure --with-pythonmodule, , fix some errors in the Unbound code,  again, then you’ll have the generated python module () in order to remove all the missing-method red error lines in PyCharm.Smoke Test: A Python DNS-Hijacking ScriptHere is a smoke test of the ability to hijack  DNS requests with reply IPs that the script has caught in just a few minutes (the timestamps are just to maintain a crude LRU cache):Duplicate IP addresses are possible, and that is fine. I let the smoke test run overnight. Here is the PoC (proof of concept) script I ran as the Unbound Python module script.When I woke up, the Unbound DNS resolver service . Here are the logs: Capturing all the IPs from the DNS queries to  and  puts pfSense into a crawl as all the rules need to be reloaded on each addition. Research and install a Squid-like proxy, create a fake-but-trusted CA certificate, host it, install it in a browser as a PoC, decode TLS traffic, and victory dance.Actually, it is  illegal to jailbreak most Apple TV boxes, so we could break in, add a root certificate valid for the pfSense box, MITM traffic from the Apple TV, and then Microsoft Bob is your uncle. That works because the pfSense box as the gateway can decrypt Apple TV traffic, inspect the request headers for the offending ad , block the request, and re-encrypt other valid requests to Mountainview, California.But, then my iPhone would still show ads because it is harder to jailbreak, plus banking apps may detect this and not work anymore. Jailbreaking is too extreme, anyway. I used a jailbroken iPhone all the time in Japan because of a quirky cellphone law. You see, because of icky perverts who like to take photos inappropriately on elevators and escalators, Japan passed a law that made the camera shutter sound mandatory on all photos.Super unfortunate was that taking a  of a web page also made the same loud, unmuteable shutter sound. Imagine you are on a train and you screenshot a Google map, it makes that loud shutter noise, and then you get dirty looks from the train riders. Yeah, I had to jailbreak and zero out the camera sound file.Let’s see what it takes to spy on the HTTPS traffic from the Apple TV and iPhone to see if we can block ad URLs that way.Install a Fake-but-Trusted CA Cert on Apple TV and iPhone?Not wanting to jailbreak and add self-signed certs to Apple TV and iPhone, how hard would it be instead to add fake-but-trusted Certificate Authority (CA) certificates to each device?The ‘A’ in CA means there is no one higher to vet such a certificate. The ‘A’ is so powerful, that back in 2001 only a Windows patch was able to revoke some dangerous Verisign certificates. As a thought experiment, new CAs must come into existence from time to time. Let’s Encrypt is relatively new, for example. There should then be an in-warranty way to get a fake, trusted CA cert into an Apple TV and iPhone. If that is possible, then an entire world of MITM spycraft is available to decrypt TLS packets in the clear and use good ‘ol URL blocking on requests likeLet’s see how easy this would be.In fact, there are many, many CAs. Here is a quick  in pfSense:Experiment with Squid and SquidGuardI’m aware of mitmproxy, but it needs to be side-channel installed onto the pfSense router. Let’s see if the  proxy that is available as a pfSense package can do what we need. First, I will take a bare-metal backup again so I can roll back in case  is better.I’ve installed those packages, and naturally, there are more buttons and options than in a space shuttle. I’ll find a guide.I’ve followed the steps in the guide, however, since I have a large SSD and generous RAM, I’ve made a dedicated folder  (and ) with 8 GiB of cache and a juicy allowance on the per-item cache size which should also help with Docker and NPM speed-up. Two birds, one stone. With Transparent HTTPS support, this should be pretty rad. If web traffic slows down while using Squid, here are some System Tunables that can make Squid faster (ref):kern.ipc.nmbclusters 32768Also, for local disk cache,  is asynchronous  (great for Docker too) and uses POSIX-threads to avoid blocking the main Squid process on disk-I/O.We can actually generate a CA cert in pfSense itself.Now, how to get it into the Apple TV and iPhone? It should be hosted somewhere, right? How about on the router?Self-Host the MITM CA CertificateSelf-hosting with a single command is ridiculously easy. From the SSH shell into pfSense, I can create a web folder and server like so:When I visit  I should get a blank page with “Hello”. From here, clients behind the pfSense router can temporarily access static documents.To make like easier, here is a PHP script to cause the MITM cert to download.As another smoke test, I’ll add the MITM CA to Chrome (manually) and enable the SSL Filtering. The defaults are fine in Squid. Here is the log file when I visit :However, on every other browser and machine there are HTTPS errors like so: If you get locked out of pfSense with a TLS error, you may have to disable Remote Cert Checks as the pfSense web configurator uses a self-signed certificate. Or else, you can bypass the proxy for the pfSense UI under Bypass Proxy for These Destination IPs with pfsense; pfsense.localdomain.Abandoning Squid: Too Slow, Too HeavyAfter a day of painfully setting up Squid and SquidGuard and adding blacklists and even manual regex for things like , I’m having nothing but issues with Squid. Here are the top pain points:It’s slow. It’s really slow.The ACL (Access Control List) settings are cumbersome.There is an issue with  (ref).The SquidGuard URL filter takes eons to update a list.The Squid UI is unbelievably lacking.Squid makes me sad. I don’t get sad, but Squid makes me sad with its promise and ultimate letdown. I’ve now obliterated Squid and restored the router from the  backup I made earlier. Here is a handy little script to show a diff of what has been added by Squid and related packages.The output is something like this under the  option:Install MITMProxy in a FreeBSD JailEven though written in Python, I’ll give mitmproxy a try next; at the very least it can be purpose-built to block YouTube ads with its rich API and Python-hook extensibility. It was a coin toss between  and  – a Metasploit hack tool – to achieve on-the-fly TLS interception, but the former can be scripted with Python and has a satisfying UI. Let’s go. Please read the whole section before trying any commands because I backtracked a bit but want to explain why.You’ll notice that there are only three binaries about 24 MiB each. As I understand it, they have a self-contained Python 3 environment and frozen dependencies. I’d like to jail these binaries because, well, because. First, let’s see if there is a vulnerability report for  at vuxml.freebsd.org. Nothing. How about at Exploit-DB? Nothing again. Good.First, what version of FreeBSD is this pfSense install?Now, according to this guide, I’ll need to set up jails myself as they are disabled in a default pfSense installation. Not knowing FreeBSD at all before today, I had to hack around to find a URL to download the  package manually. After another bare-metal backup, here are the steps I took:We need to do some hacking to get  working on pfSense’s take on FreeBSD because  is missing completely. What I’ve done is copy the  binaries  a jail (via ) back to the root system.Let’s set up a jail for . We must enable raw sockets in this jail to allow transparent proxy mode to work. If not, MITMProxy will report errors like “Transparent mode failure: FileNotFoundError(2, ‘No such file or directory’)” or “Cannot open connection, no hostname given.” This is because raw sockets are inaccessible and server information is unavailable. We can easily edit the  config file per jail like so: MITMProxy calls sudo -n /sbin/pfctl -s state but there is no  in . Run  inside the jail. If you are unsuccessful when you run  inside the jail, you may get an error like this: “ssend socket: Operation not permitted”. If you are successful, then  works as it needs access to raw sockets.Now we can copy over the  binaries and take them for a spin.Things are getting tricky with this next part. Running any of the binaries above results in:So, there is no  folder nor any similar dynamic linker that I could find. I tried this, however:Apparently, there is a  that can solve this for us (unavailable on pfSense), however, this is getting ridiculous! Let’s try a new tactic. Since we are in a jail, we are not bound to the crippled (read: secured) pfSense environment. Maybe we can install the  package normally in a jail?And, Bingo was his name-o. After this, simply running  in the jailed console opens the MITMProxy UI. Nice. Note, this version  be one or two minor versions behind the master branch. Let’s clean up with  and do another bare-metal backup.This is getting exciting. First, in pfSense, add a virtual IP for  attached to . Then, add a NAT rule to temporarily forward port  to  to access the proxy from the LANs.If not in the jail console, I’ll runand add the proxy setting  to my sacrificial notebook (that is auto-wiped daily). When the browser opens, we can already see colourful log entries in the MITMProxy UI.The next step is to get the auto-generated CA PEM file used by MITMProxy (~/.mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem). Since any CA cert here is snake oil, I’ll use the provided one. TLS traffic from my devices is safe as long as I use my own proxies.Let’s put our experience from our previous attempt at self-hosting a CA into action. However, there is no PHP in the jail, so we can use a Python 3 web server instead. MITMProxy conveniently has onboarding settings to serve the same CA cert, as we did manually, just by visiting .After installing the CA in the Trusted Root Store on my clean notebook (and rebooting), I am treated to this display:Let’s see if we can get this cert on my iPhone.This is incredibly exciting. Can we LoJack the Apple TV box next?But wait, the router is slowing down.  is burning up the CPU… on idle.Of course: Python is a single-threaded paradigm with the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) ensuring threads do not actually run concurrently – unless they are blocking on I/O, which is the case here(?). Except, most of the CPU work is to generate TLS certs on the fly for each request. Yikes. Running  forgoes the UI and extreme logging. The extreme logging of all the headers and full responses heavily slows down , but  by default only logs entries like classic Apache logs – much kinder on the CPU. Some advanced, high-security web servers have trouble with the MITMProxy certificates due to Certificate Pinning – this is a technique where the server or the client know the fingerprint of the expected certificate in advance so it cannot be forged. A workaround is to use the  option to let them bypass the proxy.For my fun, I’ll go with this CLI command:While on YouTube, we can see the page ads clear as day with their unencrypted headers; can a simple regex now block them? They are exposed, and afraid, and their days have run out.We can even see details about each request. For example, all the SAN info is laid out for this wide-reaching certificate. There are curiously a lot of  domains covered by this cert.Shortly, I’ll write a Python script to block YouTube  URLs.Patch MITMProxy Source Code for Server SNI InterrogationThis step may be optional for most, but as a reminder to myself, to make  work better in Transparent Proxy Mode, the SNI of the server request needs to be checked against the list of regular expressions or else only the server’s IP is used for matching in many cases. Here is a quick patch I made that can be applied directly in the jail shell (or just type a few lines manually) for  version 7.0.4:Index:venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mitmproxy/addons/next_layer.pySubsystem:com.intellij.openapi.diff.impl.patch.CharsetEP===================================================================diff--gita/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mitmproxy/addons/next_layer.pyb/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mitmproxy/addons/next_layer.pyWith the above patch, I can now reliably intercept a few hosts and let all others pass through.Smoke Test: Intercept YouTube Ads with MITMProxyAfter reading the docs and navigating the  source code in the PyCharm IDE, I’ve written a little script to block ads and tracking URLs coming from YouTube from my clean notebook. I won’t reproduce the code just yet because it didn’t succeed in blocking ads as hoped, so instead, I’ll spend the time investigating why.Here are the smoke test filters I used where for a given top-level domain, URLs with the following partial strings are blocked:My initial results on blocking are positive. Everything I wanted to be blocked is faithfully blocked. Note, the  entries are due to my script, and the  failures are due to pfBlockerNG black-holing the request.Even in the DevTools network panel, the requests are truly blocked.Then how come I am still seeing ads? I’ve disabled HTTP/2 so that subsequent requests on the same channel don’t slide by. Mind you, sometimes the ads skip on their own, or fail to play, but they still show up. Interesting. Could YouTube be using WebSockets? I need some inspiration, so I’ll look at uBlock Origin’s regex filters for some ideas. If you see the error , then the DNS blocker (i.e. pfBlockerNG) is breaking the upstream TLS handshake for a given domain. Either whitelist it in pfBlockerNG (so the request goes through), or intercept it and block the connection in . This error happens to black-holed domains when the upstream TLS cert cannot be sniffed. The cleanest strategy is to use .Examine uBlock Origin Regex Patterns for InspirationHere are some of the regex/filters that uBlock Origin uses on YouTube.At first blush, it seems that a community of like-minded individuals is playing whack-a-mole with YouTube’s HTML and JavaScript. This has got me thinking: How does a video know to play an ad with JavaScript?How does YouTube know if the ad converts? They must target ads for individuals, so a given video must receive some unique information about an ad, such as the click link and alt text. WebSockets would be a pain to maintain, especially with all the mobile clients. They must be using stateless JSON to relay that pertinent information in an innocuous URL request that has no telltale signs of ad-ness. Let’s hunt for this info in the JSON replies captured by .Snap, Crackle, and Pop. We have a new plan: surgically alter the JSON response body to eliminate or Byzantine-up the ad information.Surgically Alter the JSON Response to Remove AdsAfter a bit more playful exploration, a trove of blocklorne URLs is right there in the JSON payload. In fact, most of what I am trying to block shows up right here:However, YouTube has bobby-trapped their UI and there is more than one way their obfuscated JavaScript code can pull down the ad details.Let’s blow it all away right now.After a lot of fun taking apart the YouTube UI and HTTP workflow, taking into account cookies and naughty service workers, I am successfully able to strip away all the pre-roll, post-roll, mid-video, and, well, all the video ads. Here is a screenshot from  showing how select REST queries are intercepted, decrypted, modified, put back into the response, and the headers updated (content length, etc.).With this new ability, we could even inject JavaScript into the main YouTube web page and subvert their JavaScript in a sort of ECMAScript arms race, possibly even leveraging some of the filters from uBlock Origin. However, we can hang our hats on this accomplishment for today. We can strip out ads from the JSON payload for YouTube web ads using a router.The iOS YouTube App Uses Protobuf, not JSONI can see very similar data in the Protocol Buffer (Protobuf) version of the same API calls as the web version to that of the YouTube iOS app. That complicates things, somewhat: We cannot lean on JSONPath to hunt down advertisement sections of JSON because with Protobuf the keys are just numbers that can even change. YouTube compiles a large list of all the ads you are going to see and sends that to you in a sneaky payload. In fact, it is easier to visualize this when reading Protobuf. If you manage to exhaust that list, then another large list will be coming your way.I can see strings like “Telus” and “Samsung TV” and “Boxing Week” and “Buy now”. Remember when YouTube was a fun place? A fable about a Golden Goose comes to mind, Alphabet.As a consequence of being able to see unencrypted traffic from my iPhone, I’m taken aback by the sheer amount of tracking information laid bare; It’s like I have electrodes on my head and chest while I’m running on a treadmill and a bunch of scientists in white lab coats with clipboards are standing shoulder-to-shoulder recording everything about my internals. Your apps are tracking you like crazy: what you do, how long you dwell, when you leave a given app, and so much more. The URL https://play.googleapis.com/log/batch shows up a lot in my logs.The next question is: Does the iOS app protocol behave like the web app?Timing Analysis to Detect Ad Videos?The iOS network traffic is not like the web traffic; Google has teams and teams of engineers dedicated to making sure blocking their ads isn’t computationally feasible. Daunted but undeterred, I was staring at network requests to let my mind zone out and wander when I noticed a pattern I had not noticed before.For the  version of YouTube, I can eyeball which URLs are ads and which are the videos I want to watch. Take a look:How am I able to eyeball which video URLs are ads in this chaos?Take a look at the query parameter . For the web version, a chunk of the video I want is fetched from the 0th byte, then immediately another video is fetched with a  starting again at the 0th byte. Both happen near-simultaneously – faster than a human can click on a new video. It turns out this, as well as examining the  parameter for the length of the full video (short videos are likely ads), can reasonably allow us to detect and doctor ad videos.However, the iOS YouTube protocol does  use the  query parameter or even the  header; video chunks use a counter like  and  etc. We must reverse engineer the Protobuf responses.Decode the YouTube Protobuf ResponsesHere are some decoded Protobuf log files I created then opened in the PyCharm IDE.After logging decoded Protobuf messages to disk for offline analysis, I did notice something that piqued my interest.entitlemententitlementI wonder what would happen if I were to, say, toggle those? This is tantalizing, but it is cheating, and hence no fun. Back to heuristics. As with JSON, can I blow away the Protobuf sections that serve up ads? Could I instead detect the ad videos in the payload, then dynamically modify their responses to be, say, a cached 0.01s video file? The 30s ~ 300s of unskippable ads could be over in the blink of an eye without blocking all those URLs.Let’s start by blocking the ads as intended.The Protobuf responses are a hot mess of bytes, but there are human-readable URLs that can be grepped.You’d think a simple LRU cache that blocks soon-encountered ad URLs could be the way to go, but, alas, the ad URLs do not quite match the URLs sent over the wire. Also, who is to say that YouTube won’t randomize the position of query-string parameters one day? We need an  lookup of flagged ad URLs that are polymorphic (and group homomorphic) to live ad URLs.It might be tempting to split a query string into a sorted dictionary and reassemble it, but we have no way of knowing what the query string boundary is. Plus, a live ad URL could add a key and disrupt the sorting.Addionally, I’ve encountered URLs like this that purposely try to obfuscate the query params:https://r4—sn-vgqsrns6.googlevideo.com/videoplayback/expire/1640607416/ei/WFrJYdWnFfyTsfIP4s2BsAk/id/o-AE7swWOPOwXu3GyRght/requiressl/yesmm/31,26/…Notice how  is just ?I propose heuristically scanning for query and path parameters of ad URLs with high entropy and using those as keys (fingerprints). For example, inhttps://.googlevideo.com/initplayback?source=youtube&orc=1&oeis=1&c=IOS&oss=1&oda=1&oad=5500&ovd=5500&oaad=11000&oavd=11000&ocs=700&oputc=1&oses=1&ofpcc=1&osbr=1&osnz=1&msp=1&odeak=1&odepv=1&osfc=1&id=&ip=&initcwndbps=&mt=One could note the following candidates in descending order of length:Any or all of them could be lookup keys each pointing to the same dictionary of deconstructed query parameters. A lookup of a live URL would involve the same process of finding the highest entropy parameters and checking the URL dictionary for a match. The cache data structure can even be multi-level with the root keys being just the length of the high-entropy strings. Even with the ability to block polymorphic URLs, the video ads are still indistinguishable from content video without context from the Protobuf structure.Smoke Test: Intercept and Decode Protobuf in Python Decoding ~500 kiB of raw Protobuf in pure Python is painfully slow.Decoding ~500 kiB of Protobuf in pure Python, especially the decoding step of converting it to over 1 MiB of human-readable text to parse the ad URLs, takes more time than the connection timeout most of the time. I’ll run some benchmarks using pure Python vs. the native C++ library.If you caught that, it takes about  in Python, and  in C++! In this Never Ending Story, we have to find a way to parse the raw Protobuf payloads in Python using the C++ library . In the interest of time, I’ll use  and communicate with the C++  binary directly (since raw decoding is not supported in Python anyway).Fuzzing the YouTube Video Ad ResponsesHow about fuzzing the ad video responses? Now being able to isolate ad videos, as a smoke test, I sent back  responses with empty bodies and the iOS app went bananas; it was as if there is an infinite loop with no delay just hammering YouTube’s own servers trying to get the next part of the video in panic mode. I felt bad for their servers, so I stopped. Then, what would a happy-path response payload look like?Try as I might, when I send back empty s, s, s, truncate response bodies, or just null-out part of the ad video, the iOS app crawls then crashes spectacularly with a dying breath of a messed up iOS UI. I now block some error reporting endpoint at  that indicates a “dev assertion failed” so I don’t make some overworked QA pull out their hair. We’ve learned that blocking ad URLs causes the app to deploy countermeasures and even when defeated, the app hangs forever on the ad screen. We’ve also learned that fuzzing ad videos often causes the app to crash – there is even session meta data in the video response chunks.Let’s go back to what worked with JSON and obliterate the section of the Protobuf responses that contain the array of ad details.Enter Burp Suite Tools for Penetration TestingThere is a library for Burp Suite called  (get the original Burp Suite version,  the PyPi fork, unless you like infinite recursion bugs) that is designed to decode raw Protobuf wire messages, inject something naughty, then re-encode them again to see how a Protobuf endpoint behaves. We are going to have so much fun together in this next section.You may encounter a small world of pain because some forks of blackboxprotobuf will cause a stack overflow due to deep recursion. You can see this by adding sys.setrecursionlimit(200).Compiling the original library source code for Burp Suite and using the C++ bindings will allow us to transcode ~500 kiB of raw Protobuf bytes in just a few seconds. At the top of your import chain before you import , addto use the C++  implementation whenever possible.It is now possible to generate a best-guess  schema with a single function:The schema isn’t perfect, and it is huge and deeply nested, and takes forever to pretty-print, and is probably wrong, but is just good enough to pull out the ad details like so (Protobuf to JSON in this sample):The Python schema is huge and looks like this for about 250,000 more charcters:Reverse engineering the Protobuf schema sounds good on paper, but our target is spectacularly complex and a moving target.Exfil the Proto Schemas from the App, Cleanly?As fun as it to reverse the Protobuf and generate a best-guess schema, wouldn’t it be more ninja-like to exfil the actual, working  or schema files from the smartphone app? Let’s pull out the Protobuf schemas from the Android version of the YouTube app and see if the schemas are the same or compatible.This is what I tried , but it went nowhere with the Protobuf Toolkit (PBTK). I reproduce it here so I remember what I tried:After installing Qt dependencies (pronounced “cute”), I was treated to a GUI.Next, I got the most recent release of a 100 MiB Android APK file from apkpure.com.Excited in vain, the most PBTK could get was a 59-byte proto file. Another tool called Apktool also looked promising, but the best it can do is  bytecode, not decompile it – this may be good enough for Pen Testers, however.You can see that Google went out of its way to complicate reverse engineering.Google thoughtfully did leave some hints.Upon deeper inspection, the Protobuf classes are right here, in Java, decorated with getters and setters. Since we are using Python, and we cannot get the true schema files, I will leave this approach for now.Hardcore Deep-Dive into Protobuf and Wire FormatAfter gazing into a sea of decrypted network traffic again, then triggering errors and assertion fails on my iPhone with Protobuf fuzzing, and taking a peek at the error logs being phoned home, I’ve noticed that ads register for “slots” in a given video. They can register for pre-roll, mid-roll, end-roll, full-page, and ad pods (back-to-back ads). Blocking an ad URL causes an error along the lines of “some ad that doesn’t exist booked a slot” and UI panic sets in.I’m back. The Wire Format is surprisingly elegant, except for ZigZag encoding. Through trial and error, editing out chunks of Protobuf with a hex editor is just a no-go.While computationally expensive, decoding, editing, and re-encoding without the original schema leads to a modified encoding. This is likely because we cannot detect if ZigZag encoding is being used, or if a number is an , , , , etc., plus the order of object fields is normally non-deterministic. Here is some Protobuf trivia on the matter:Exploit a Protobuf Flaw to Easily Remove All Ads by Changing One ByteCasually poring over the C++ source code, an interesting comment in the Protobuf code caught my eye: is used to keep track of fields that were seen when parsing a protocol message but whose field numbers or types are unrecognized. This most frequently occurs when new fields are added to a message type and then messages containing those fields are read by old software that was compiled before the new types were added. (ref)Yes, what to do with unknown fields? What to do indeed. And, how easy would it be to say, change a  field key to, say,  thus making an entire substructure of advertisement and tracking information suddenly unavailable? Tantalizing.And, if we can calculate the field tags in bytes with bit-twiddling, then can we use a simple regex to AMF the section of ads in  time?As a motivating example, I’d like to find the field key  which is not as simple as searching for . Here is an implementation of a tag-scanning algorithm so you can see the bit-twiddling:We know the wire type is  (length-delimited nested string/message), and one target field  is . When bit-twiddled, we get the target where the final  happens to mean  (the wire type) in hex. In binary, this is:10101010 11111111 10111000 10111100 00000001Let’s lose the MSB from each byte as per the var-length wire format:.0101010 .1111111 .0111000 .0111100 .0000001Then we shift and add only the first four bytes since the LSB is first:Finally, we shift out the number of wire type bits (3) to get back the field key:395198378 >> 3 = 49399797And that, folks, is a taste of how Wire Format works.Fantastic. Now, all we have to do is scan the Protobuf bytes for classic ad URL signatures like  to bound our field search, then move backward from there until we find the target(s) field tags and thus field keys we would like to denature (e.g.  –> ).Notice how the Protobuf response payload is ? As I said, Google makes it computationally expensive to decode, alter, and re-encode without the C++ source proto files, but a quick linear scan takes no effort at all.Just a quick note, there is more than one field tag, but not all of them represent ads. That is why we need to backtrack from the  markers.Smoke Test: Remove Ads from Protobuf in O(n)-Time In one pass with no additional memory, I’m able to scan a huge 1.8 MiB chunk of jibberish-looking Protobuf data, and in the screenshot below only at the 30,593 byte (of 1.8 MiB) is our target found, and then backtracking ~600 characters yields our target field key to denature. Not only is this amazing, but I don’t even need to block  or URLs with  in them; Those requests are never made in the first place, anymore.Analysis of this Successful Adblocking TechniqueBy taking advantage of a feature (flaw?) in Protobuf that allows it to be backward compatible with schema changes, along with the fact that Protobuf is very sensitive to byte changes due to its compact nature, we can change a single byte in a critical location and tell Protobuf that an entire section of deeply-nested data is from a future schema version and it should be ignored.Google returns huge responses in Protobuf (e.g. 1.8 MiB) – including even the layout of the iOS app – so only C++/Swift is fast enough to understand it all before the connection times out. I’ve shown that Python is several orders of magnitude too slow in decoding these Protobuf payloads, so connections do time out waiting on Python. With web-based JSON, the whole payload needs to be parsed, edited, and re-serialized; With my Protobuf technique, it takes microseconds thanks to a single linear scan and then ultra-quick backtracking. This technique is suitable for real-time adblocking without blocklists.All those  and  URLs on Apple devices originate from the Protobuf payload. This means they all go away for free – we don’t need to block them. In fact, the YouTube app is zippier because fewer connections are made to ad URLs in the first place. This means we can avoid keeping a blocklist of YouTube ad URLs and stay on the sidelines of the whack-a-mole fun. Ads do not register for video location “slots” on the Apple devices and the content just plays.This is a heuristic technique that looks for two strings:  and some calculated field tag nearby, so this technique is designed to be future-proof.Even if Google changes the field tag (and breaks millions of apps and Apple TVs before they upgrade), it’s an academic exercise to enhance the following script to discover the new field tag(s) automatically.Should Google be Worried?This is a highly-specialized technique to block Apple-device YouTube ads (or Instagram, Whatsapp, Facebook, etc. tracker blocking). The CPU requirements to decrypt and re-encrypt HTTPS traffic greatly exceed those available to Raspberry Pis. Even if some company takes my script and considers making and selling a NIC dongle, it would likely not be powerful enough. An Nvidia Shield could handle it, but if you already have Android devices, then just hack the binaries; My technique is for Apple device owners where we don’t want to compromise the OS so that further reduces the audience of this technique.The MITMProxy YouTube Adblocking ScriptHere is the MITMProxy addon script that serves as a proof-of-concept to block YouTube ads on networked Apple devices. The script can be run as follows (note the prerequisites in the script and be sure to install them first). Name it  and run the following command:mitmdump --listen-port 8080 --listen-host 127.0.0.1 -s "youtube.py"Here is the script, including a fairness function to allow ads 5% of the time:This script happens to work in Python for a TLS-decrypting man-in-the-middle proxy written in Python. As a working proof-of-concept, it’s pretty rad. Of course, it can be rewritten in Rust or Go or anything but single-threaded Python, but as an intellectual exercise to defeat ads that are served from the same domain as content, it’s elegant.It’s unknown if CAD  $11.99/mo ($13.43/mo with tax) is even reasonable: Do I personally incur CAD $11.99 of cost to advertisers each month?Since ads are auctioned, the CPV (cost-per-view) varies. Also, many ad campaigns have a capped daily budget, so theoretically there should be fewer ads in the evenings as budgets run out during the day.I watched YouTube on and off for a day on a clean notebook computer with private browsing. My history showed that I only “watched” 10 videos:I fast-forwarded through a few of them to get past the “like and subscribe” runtime padding.I jumped to the end of one just to get to the “top three” from a “top twenty” list.Two were low quality so I left early.The rest were music videos.In all, for watching parts of 10 videos, I was exposed to 8 ads, and only two were skippable (which I skipped).Let’s use USD $0.15 as a CPV. In one day, let’s say, I incurred 8 x $0.15, or $1.20 to advertisers. Extrapolated to one month, that is roughly USD $36/mo. Do I really cost advertisers USD $36/mo for very casual YouTube viewing? That sounds terrible for advertisers.CPV from US Advertising Spend Divided by Total ViewsFrom Statistica, in 2019, US YouTube advertisers spent $15.1 billion dollars. Also in 2019, US residents had 916 billion views (ref). That works out to an average of $15.1B / 916B, or USD $0.0165 per view. Then for me, that is only USD 13 cents. Extrapolated to one month, I theoreticaly cost advertisers only USD $3.96/mo.Is YouTube Premium Worth It?When I allowed ads for my experiment, I hit the hardware mute button. I also looked away because I have several computers with a lot going on. Ad spend is wasted on me, but I still want to support content creators. For me, CAD $13.48/mo is more than I incur on actual ads and more than I pay for a Netflix subscription. The only way to justify the cost is to have YouTube playing constantly in the background on a TV.However, I truly enjoy a handful of creators, so I may start watching them in the background on non-stop play. Let’s give the three-month YouTube Premium trial a chance, and I will still be monitoring what they track about me.Recently I learned that due to abuses of the DMCA Act of 1998, YouTube content creators who make reaction videos and “easter egg” videos may have their videos claimed by big companies like Sony and Viacom. That means that from when a claim is made, all ad revenue goes to those big companies, and not even to the creators. That means in all likelihood I unknowingly may not even be supporting my favourite YouTube creators. Many fair-use and video-game-commentary videos may have automated copyright claims against them, meaning that ad revenue goes to big companies with deep legal pockets and your favourite creators may get nothing, so more and more creators leave YouTube for Twitch.Summary of AccomplishmentsI rarely give up, so this is an example of going into an extreme problem-solving mode to solve a fun problem loosely using cryptography and reverse engineering. In the end, a single byte turned it all around, so it was all worth it to come to an elegant and satisfying solution. We were able to set up a hardware router from scratch, segment LANs into trusted and untrusted zones, set up traditional DNS adblocking, add a transparent MITM proxy, and ultimately block YouTube ads on networked Apple devices.Note: This was a hard problem – now solved – so I am paying for YouTube Premium to give the CPU a rest.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>12 Must-Know Data Structures for Coding Interviews</title><link>https://blog.algomaster.io/p/12-must-know-data-structures-for-coding-interviews</link><author>Ashish Pratap Singh</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0494294c-ecd1-45f9-a1e9-98d4018a9935_1612x1060.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 06:25:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://blog.algomaster.io/">Dev - Algomaster</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cracking a coding interview isn’t just about writing code—it’s about solving problems . And to do that, you need to think in terms of data structures. The right data structure can mean the difference between an algorithm that runs in milliseconds and one that times out completely.While there are many data structures in computer science, some appear in coding interviews far more frequently than others.In this article, we’ll go over 12 essential data structures that you must know for coding interviews.An  is a contiguous block of memory that stores elements of the same data type. Each element is identified by an index, allowing constant-time access (O(1)).An array is stored . Given an index, the memory address is calculated as:Address = Base Address + (Index × Size of each element)This is why accessing an element by index is —the address is computed directly.You need  to elements using an index ().The number of elements is fixed or changes infrequently.You want a  way to store sequential data.Memory locality is important (since arrays are contiguous, CPU caching is optimized).Time & Space ComplexitiesSpace Complexity:  (since arrays store  elements) – In Java, arrays have a  once created. You cannot dynamically resize an array. – If you need resizing, use , which internally  when capacity is exceeded.A  is essentially a , where data is arranged in .A matrix is stored in memory  in most programming languages (including Java). Each element is accessed using .When working with  (chessboard, Sudoku, word search).For , like linear algebra, transformations, or machine learning.For  using adjacency matrices.In  (storing pixels as a 2D array).In  (e.g.,  for problems like ).Time & Space ComplexitiesSpace Complexity:  (since we store  elements).A  is a  where elements (nodes) are connected via  instead of being stored in a contiguous memory block. Each node consists of: – The actual value stored in the node. – A reference to the next node in the list.Unlike arrays, linked lists don’t require pre-allocated memory and allow , making them efficient for insertions and deletions.How is a Linked List Representedclass Node {
    int data;

    }
}1. Singly Linked List (SLL)Each node has a  pointer to the next node.One-directional traversal.2. Doubly Linked List (DLL)Each node has  and  pointers.Allows .3. Circular Linked List (CLL)The last node  to the head, forming a loop.When to Use a Linked List?When insertions/deletions are frequent (since they are O(1) at the head or tail).When memory fragmentation is a concern (as nodes are dynamically allocated).When  is required.When building LRU caches, stacks, and queues.Time & Space ComplexitiesA  is a key-value pair data structure that provides fast lookups, insertions, and deletions using . Unlike arrays or linked lists, HashMaps allow constant-time (O(1)) operations on average, making them extremely efficient for many applications.How is a HashMap Represented?A  is internally implemented using an array of linked lists (buckets). When a key-value pair is inserted:The key is  to generate an index.The value is stored in the bucket corresponding to that index.If multiple keys hash to the same index (), a linked list (or balanced BST) is used to store multiple values at that index.Keys → Hash Function → Bucket Index
"John" → hash("John") → 2  →  [ ("John", 25) ]
"Mary" → hash("Mary") → 5  →  [ ("Mary", 30) ]
"Tom"  → hash("Tom")  → 2  →  [ ("John", 25), ("Tom", 40) ] (collision)If two keys hash to the same bucket,  (linked list or tree) resolves the conflict.When  are required.When frequent insertions and deletions are needed.When implementing caches, frequency counters, and indexing.When storing mappings between two datasets, e.g., usernames to user IDs.Time & Space ComplexitiesA  is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means the last element added is the first one to be removed—like a stack of plates in a cafeteria.Push(10) → [10]
Push(20) → [10, 20]
Push(30) → [10, 20, 30]
Pop()    → [10, 20]  (30 is removed)

Linked list-based stacks are  but use extra memory for pointers.A  is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. The element added  is removed , just like a real-world queue at a ticket counter.Enqueue(5) → [5]
Enqueue(2) → [5, 2]
Enqueue(9) → [5, 2, 9]
Enqueue(4) → [5, 2, 9, 4]
Dequeue()  → [2, 9, 4]  (5 is removed)
Front()    → 2  (Next to be removed)Queues support enqueue (insert), dequeue (remove), front (peek), and isEmpty operations.How is a Queue Represented?Queues can be implemented using: (Fixed size, efficient indexing) (Dynamic size, memory overhead)When FIFO (First-In-First-Out) ordering is required.When processing tasks in  (e.g., scheduling, messaging).When implementing BFS (Breadth-First Search) in graphs.When handling , like task scheduling in OS.Time & Space ComplexitiesA  is a hierarchical data structure that consists of  connected by . Unlike arrays, linked lists, stacks, or queues (which are linear structures), trees are  and provide fast search, insert, and delete operations in structured data. – A node that has child nodes is called a parent. – Nodes with no children. – The longest path from the root to a leaf.The most popular type of tree is binary tree where each node has .How is a Tree Represented?Trees are implemented using :class TreeNode {

Unlike a binary tree, where each node contains a value, a Trie node represents a , and words are formed by linking nodes together.Consider inserting the words: "ace", "ant", "cat", "pen" and "pet" into a Trie:The main advantage of a Trie is fast prefix-based searching, making it ideal for applications like autocomplete, spell checkers, and IP routing.How is a Trie Represented?A HashMap/Array of child nodes (storing characters). indicating the end of a word.class TrieNode {

On Saturday night, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued a verbal order blocking Trump from using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport noncitizens, but all three planes left and landed in El Salvador.

This is the end result of
seven years of hard work by volunteer developers, designers, artists, and community members (for reference,  2.10 was first published in 2018
and the initial development version of  3.0 was released in 2020). With  3.0 you can do more than ever before, more easily, more quickly!While we can’t cover every single change in  from 2.10, we want to highlight some of the biggest ones as you start exploring this new release.Need to tweak a filter you applied hours ago?
New in  3.0 is non-destructive editing for
most commonly-used filters. See the changes in
real time with on-canvas preview.Exchange files with more applications, including
 files as well as better  export and
many new formats.Don’t know how big to make your drawing?
Simply set your paint tool to expand layers automatically as needed.Making pro-quality text got easier, too. Style your text,
apply outlines, shadows, bevels, and more, and you can
still edit your text, change font and size,
and even tweak the style settings.Organizing your layers has become much easier with the ability to
  select multiple items at once, move them or transform them all together!Color Management was again improved, as our long-term project to make
   an advanced image editor for all usages.Updated graphical toolkit () for modern desktop usage.We’ve prepared release notes to go over all the changes, improvements, new features, and more. And if you’d like even more details, you can peruse the  changelog for all 2.99 and 3.0  releases.But to see it for yourself, you can get  3.0 directly from our Downloads page and try it out!Other Releases in GIMPVerseTo accompany our release of  3.0.0, packagers should also be aware
that we released: 3.0 is a new milestone. The application is in active
development and if you think this is awesome, wait until
you see our plans for the future!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: I Built an iOS app to locate stray animals</title><link>https://apps.apple.com/us/app/straysync/id6742747753</link><author>Ic3creaM</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 22:05:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Locate & help stray animals with StraySync!

Across all categories, only about 20% of apps achieve the $1,000 threshold, while just 5% reach $10,000 monthly. 

In 2025, the top 5% of apps generate 500 times more revenue than the remaining 95% -- up from 200 times in 2024. After one year, elite performers in gaming, photo and video, health and fitness, and social categories exceed $5,000 monthly, while those in the 25th percentile earn a meager $5-20 per month. The report also highlights North American developers' heavy iOS dependence, with 76.1% making over 80% of their revenue from Apple's platform.

Conflicting religions fill the world. Doctrines about God contradict one another. No one denies the diversity of religions and the apparent incompatibility of their core beliefs. Many believe only their own religion to be the truth. Some claim all religions reflect the same truth. Others assert that differing dogmas expose the emptiness of all religion.

RDAP offers several advantages over WHOIS including support for internationalization, secure access to data, authoritative service discovery, and the ability to provide differentiated access to registration data. RDAP was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force.RDAP has been offered by ICANN-accredited registrars and gTLDs since 2019.To request access to nonpublic gTLD registration data, use the Registration Data Request Service (RDRS) for participating registrars or contact the sponsoring registrar directly to determine their disclosure process. Please make sure you have first checked that the data is unavailable through the ICANN Lookup tool.

But in Germany, almost all the country’s natural peatlands have been drained. Now, they’re emitting greenhouse gases. People around the world are currently working to rewet the moors - while keeping them usable for agriculture.

Dry peatlands are responsible for seven percent of all greenhouse gas emissions in Germany. Taken together, all the moorland areas in Germany cover over 1.5 million hectares. However, much of this moorland has given way to pasture and arable land over the centuries. Drained, the moors lose their ability to store greenhouse gases. In Germany alone, they could store about as much carbon as the entire German forest - but they must remain wet.

Scientists Greta Gaudig and Sabine Wichmann from the "Greifswald Moor Centrum” are working on a strategy to rewet the moors, while keeping them usable for agriculture. To accomplish this, they are testing the cultivation of peat mosses and cattails. These materials could be used to produce environmentally friendly potting soil and building materials. This way, farmers could continue generating income while saving the moors.

In Bristol, young entrepreneurs are producing a sustainable down substitute using cattails. With success: because the product is selling well, several farmers in England are converting their drained fields back to wet moorland for farming. For the first time, they have found a way to protect the moors and continue to make a living from their land.

 In 2023 I tried out Codon. At the time I had difficulty compiling the scripts I most commonly used, but was excited by the prospect. Python is essentially single threaded and checks the shape (type) of each variable as it interprets scripts. Codon fixes types and compiles Python into compact, executable binaries that execute much faster. 

Several things have changed with their latest release: I have successful compiles, the committers have added a compiled version of NumPy (high performance math algorithms), and changed their open source license to Apache 2. 

"The other big news is that Exaloop, the company that is behind Codon, has changed their license to Apache 2..." according to the article, so "commercial use and derivations of Codon are now permitted without licensing."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>David Shatz - What is Free Will?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brQxb_v3KsI</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/brQxb_v3KsI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 15:00:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Like Closer To Truth on Facebook for daily videos, updates, announcements, and much more: https://shorturl.at/tak4l

ABSTRACT
So far, most attention to GenAI in software development is on generating code. But there is as much, if not more, value in understanding existing code - particularly long-lived, large, and complex legacy systems.

At Thoughtworks we have been experimenting with using this technology with our clients, embodied in a tool called CodeConcise, which combines an LLM with a knowledge graph derived from the abstract syntax trees of a codebase. We have found this useful both to draw out low-level requirements and to build a high-level explanation of a system.

This talk will show what we have learned and how it could change the age old challenge of wrangling legacy at speed, iteratively and with zero downtime. [...]

This might involve switching to a server with more CPU cores, higher memory, or better disk performance (e.g., moving from HDDs to NVMe SSDs).Increasing Resource Allocations – If you're using a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure), you can resize instances dynamically. For example, upgrading from an AWS RDS  instance to a  instance.Database Engine Optimizations – Tuning configurations such as increasing buffer pool size in MySQL () or allocating more shared memory in PostgreSQL (). – Moving from traditional HDDs to SSDs or leveraging NVMe storage to reduce disk I/O bottlenecks.When Should You Consider Using Vertical Scaling?When your workload fits within the limits of a single machine and you want  without introducing the complexity of distributed databases.When , and distributing queries across multiple nodes introduces unwanted overhead.When your application is still , and horizontal scaling (sharding or replication) is unnecessary.When you need a quick and cost-effective solution in the short term without redesigning the system architecture.Limitations of Vertical Scaling – There's a ceiling to how much you can scale a single machine. Even the largest cloud instance has limits. – A vertically scaled database is a single machine. If it crashes, everything goes down unless there's a failover mechanism.Expensive Beyond a Certain Point – The cost of high-end machines grows exponentially. A top-tier AWS RDS instance can cost thousands of dollars per month. – Increasing CPU, memory, or disk space often requires downtime, especially in on-premise setups.Vertical scaling is simple, effective, and easy to implement, making it a great first step for scaling a database. However, as traffic grows, a single machine will eventually hit a hard limit, forcing a move toward horizontal scaling techniques like sharding or replication. is a technique used to speed up database queries by creating a data structure that allows for faster lookups. Instead of scanning the entire table to find relevant rows, an index acts like a  in a book—helping the database locate data quickly.Imagine searching for a word in a dictionary. Without an index, you’d have to read every page. But with an alphabetically sorted index, you can jump directly to the correct section. That’s exactly how a database index works.Creating an index on a single column that is frequently used in  clauses. Example:CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);An index on multiple columns, useful when queries filter by multiple conditions. Example:CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_date ON orders(customer_id, order_date);When Should You Consider Using Indexing?When queries frequently  by a specific column (, , ).When performing  on large tables.When optimizing , where fast lookups are more critical than fast writes. – Every , , or  operation must also update the index, increasing overhead. – Indexes consume additional disk space, sometimes larger than the actual table.Not Useful for Every Query – If a query retrieves a large portion of the table, an index may not help and could even slow it down. – Too many indexes can slow down performance instead of improving it. Choosing the right indexes is key.Indexing is one of the most powerful ways to scale a database without adding more hardware. However, it requires careful planning. The  can improve query performance by orders of magnitude, while  can slow down writes and waste storage. is the process of storing frequently accessed data in a  to reduce database load and improve response times. Instead of repeatedly querying the database for the same data, applications can retrieve it from a , which is significantly faster.There are multiple caching strategies (read through, cache aside, write back etc.,) each suited for different use cases.The  pattern is widely used because it gives the application full control over caching logic.When a client requests data, the application first checks the cache.If the data exists in cache (), it is returned instantly.If data is not found (), it is fetched from the database, stored in the cache for future requests, and returned to the client.Content Delivery Network (CDN) CachingFor web applications, static content (images, videos, scripts) is cached at CDN edge servers, reducing database and server load.When Should You Consider Using Caching?When the same data is frequently accessed, such as user profiles, product catalogs, or search results.When you need , especially for real-time applications.When your database is experiencing  and you want to reduce direct database queries.When serving  like images, CSS, and JavaScript in web applications. – If the cache is not updated when the database changes, users might see outdated information.Cache Invalidation Complexity – Deciding when to refresh or expire cached data is challenging. – Caching requires additional memory (RAM), which can be expensive at scale.Not Ideal for Write-Heavy Applications – Since caches mainly optimize read performance, write-heavy applications don’t benefit as much.Caching is one of the most effective database scaling techniques because it reduces query load and improves response times. However, it requires careful cache invalidation strategies to ensure data consistency.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Archeologists Uncover The Lost World Of Roman Britain</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cm88Fd1R7sc</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/cm88Fd1R7sc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 22:00:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What was it really like to live in Roman Britain?

Hundreds of children of members of Islamic State (IS) are stuck in Syrian camps. Often, with no hope of returning to their home nations.

Around 38,000 foreign nationals - more than 60 per cent of whom are children - are being held in Al-Hol and Roj, two closed, sprawling camps in north-eastern Syria that have been holding mostly spouses, other adult female relatives and children of male IS suspects since 2019. 
Most of the children are under 14 years old and many have spent most, if not all, of their lives in the camps. Some countries, including Finland, Sweden, Russia, Germany and the USA, have allowed the repatriation of IS children. But France has taken a different position, refusing to repatriate the children, unless they are orphaned. In France, their families are waging a fierce battle against the government to bring these children home.

InfoWorld writes that "The initiative promises dramatic improvements in editor startup speed, build times, and memory usage, making it easier to scale TypeScript to large code bases, Microsoft said."

Microsoft's TypeScript team expects to be able to preview command-line type-checking in Go-based tsc by mid-2025, and to deliver a feature-complete Go implementation of TypeScript by the end of the year. [You can build and run the Go code now from Microsoft's new working repository.]
 Developers who use Go-based TypeScript in the Visual Studio Code editor will feel the increased speed in the editor, Microsoft said. The company promises an 8x improvement in project load times, instant comprehensive error listings across entire projects, and greater responsiveness for all language service operations including completion lists, quick information, go to definition, and find all references. The new TypeScript will also support more advanced refactoring and deeper insights that were previously too expensive to compute, the company said. 

Microsoft believes native Go implementations reduce build times by up to 10x, notes Neowin. But "Developers can expect TypeScript 6.0 to have some deprecations and breaking changes to support the upcoming Go-based version."

Later this year, Microsoft will be releasing this new native Go implementation as TypeScript 7.0. The current JS-based TypeScript codebase will continue development into the 6.x series until TypeScript 7+ reaches sufficient maturity and adoption, since some projects may depend on certain API features, legacy configurations, or other things that are not supported by TypeScript 7+. 
TypeScript's original creator Anders Hejlsberg recorded an announcement video — and also shared his thoughts in a GitHub discussion titled simply... "Why Go?"
The TypeScript compiler's move to Go was influenced by specific technical requirements, such as the need for structural compatibility with the existing JavaScript-based codebase, ease of memory management, and the ability to handle complex graph processing efficiently. After evaluating numerous languages and making multiple prototypes — including in C# — Go emerged as the optimal choice... 
Let's be real. Microsoft using Go to write a compiler for TypeScript wouldn't have been possible or conceivable in years past. However, over the last few decades, we've seen Microsoft's strong and ongoing commitment to open-source software, prioritizing developer productivity and community collaboration above all. Our goal is to empower developers with the best tools available, unencumbered by internal politics or narrow constraints. This freedom to choose the right tool for each specific job ultimately benefits the entire developer community, driving innovation, efficiency, and improved outcomes. And you can't argue with a 10x outcome! 

Hejlsberg also addressed their choice of Go in an online interview with the Michigan TypeScript meetup.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Neil deGrasse Tyson &amp; Charles Liu Make Predictions About the Future</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izTre_7g1XU</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/izTre_7g1XU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 15:30:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What does the future hold? Neil deGrasse Tyson teams up with comic co-host Chuck Nice, Gary O’Reilly, and astrophysicist Charles Liu to break down our visions of the future – and take Neil to task on his own predictions.

The conversation kicks off with the accuracy of science fiction predictions. Are we living in The Jetsons era yet? We explore the years that science fiction takes place and compare them with where we are now. From Amazon’s robotic warehouses to AI assistants, how much of our future is already here – and what did sci-fi get wrong?

We break down technology in Blade Runner, Black Mirror, and The Twilight Zone and question whether we’re headed straight towards a dystopian future. We discuss the purpose of predictions and how they can help us not only inform our future but act as an early warning sign. 

Plus, we discuss the Turing test and whether what we really need is a test for consciousness. Do we even need machines to mimic human thought? Can technology ever fully control human perception, or is that a fear rooted in fiction?

Looking to 2050, Neil shares predictions from his book Starry Messenger, including the rise of commercial space industries and self-driving cars. Will neuroscience cure mental illness? Will space tourism become a booming industry? Plus, Charles, Chuck, and Gary add their own predictions of the future to the conversation.

Nigerian architect Kunlé Adeyemi came up with a design that can help buildings adapt to the looming threat of climate change.   

His work began in the floating community of Makoko in the Nigerian capital Lagos. Many residents live in simple houses built on stilts over a lagoon, which makes them particularly vulnerable to rising tides and extreme weather.  

Inspired by local engineering, Adeyemi came up with the “Makoko Floating System”, which allows for buildings to float on water. Its pyramid shape makes it more stable and prevents rainwater from pooling. 

On a large scale, Adeyemi hopes that his design can help Makoko, and other places around the world, adapt to the rising sea.

Wade and James’ quest for justice began more than ten years ago when they filed civil lawsuits against some of the late entertainer’s corporations in a California court, alleging that MJJ Productions and MJJ Ventures enabled and covered up their sexual abuse as children. The Jackson lawyers have fought back, accusing the men, amongst other things, of being liars and arguing that there is no basis in law for the men’s claims. 

The documentary picks up the story of the two men’s legal battles in the wake of the 2019 release of the 'Leaving Neverland' documentary, which alleged that the entertainer had sexually abused Wade and James over a period of years. In 'Leaving Neverland 2' we see Wade’s and James’s civil cases twice thrown out by the California District Court and twice reversed on appeal by the California Court of Appeals. A civil trial is set for 2026. 

The documentary tells the story principally through the eyes of the two young men and their attorneys and their journey to a civil trial scheduled for 2026, often dipping behind the scenes to chronicle the emotional toll on James and his family. 

Material for the film was shot over a seven-year period and includes interviews with LAPD detectives who investigated Michael Jackson while he was alive, in which new details from the LAPD files are revealed.

Charities that refurbish and distribute computers to low-income individuals must choose between providing soon-to-be-insecure Windows 10 machines, transitioning to Linux -- despite usability challenges for non-tech-savvy users -- or recycling the hardware, contributing to ewaste. Tom's Hardware reports: So how bad will it really be to run an end-of-lifed Windows 10? Should people worry? [Chester Wisniewski, who serves as Director and Global Field CISO for Sophos, a major security services company] and other experts I talked to are unequivocal. You're at risk. "To put this in perspective, today [the day we talked] was Patch Tuesday," he said. "There were 57 vulnerabilities, 6 of which have already been abused by criminals before the fixes were available. There were also 57 in February and 159 in January. Windows 10 and Windows 11 largely have a shared codebase, meaning most, if not all, vulnerabilities each month are exploitable on both OSs. These will be actively turned into digital weapons by criminals and nation-states alike and Windows 10 users will be somewhat defenseless against them."
 
So, in short, even though Windows 10 has been around since 2015, there are still massive security holes being patched. Even within the past few weeks, dozens of vulnerabilities were fixed by Microsoft. So what's a charity to do when these updates are running out and clients will be left vulnerable? "What we decided to do is one year ahead of the cutoff, we discontinued Windows 10," said Casey Sorensen, CEO of PCs for People, one of the U.S.'s largest non-profit computer refurbishers. "We will distribute Linux laptops that are 6th or 7th gen. If we distribute a Windows laptop, it will be 8th gen or newer." Sorensen said that any PC that's fifth gen or older will be sent to an ewaste recycler.
 
[...] Sorensen, who founded the company in 1998, told us that he's comfortable giving clients computers that run Linux Mint, a free OS that's based on Ubuntu. The latest version of Mint, version 22.1, will be supported until 2029. "Ten years ago if we distributed Linux, they would be like what is it," he said. But today, he notes that many view their computers as windows to the Internet and, for that, a user-friendly version of Linux is acceptable.

Lip-Bu Tan has been tapped as new CEO for the semiconductor company as it has struggled with both chip manufacturing and chip designing. Unlike Intel, companies specialized in either designing chips–like AMD or Nvidia–or manufacturing chips–like TSMC. 

WSJ explains how a mistake Intel made in the mid 2000s has snowballed into an overwhelming obstacle for the tech company that Lip-Bu Tan will have to face.

From a report: The gains present "a great opportunity" for the lender to assign its engineers to other projects, Beer told Reuters ahead of DevUp, an internal conference hosted by JPMorgan, bringing together its top engineers in India this year. The largest lender in the U.S. had a technology budget of $17 billion for 2024. Its tech workforce of 63,000 employees, with a third of them based in India, represents about 21% of its global headcount. The efficiency gains from the coding assistant will also allow JPMorgan's engineers to devote more time to high-value projects focusing on artificial intelligence and data, Beer said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Researchers astonished by tool’s apparent success at revealing AI’s “hidden objectives”</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/researchers-astonished-by-tools-apparent-success-at-revealing-ais-hidden-motives/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/robot_personality-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 20:03:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In a new paper published Thursday titled "Auditing language models for hidden objectives," Anthropic researchers described how custom AI models trained to deliberately conceal certain "motivations" from evaluators could still inadvertently reveal secrets, due to their ability to adopt different contextual roles they call "personas." The researchers were initially astonished by how effectively some of their interpretability methods seemed to uncover these hidden training objectives, although the methods are still under research.While the research involved models trained specifically to conceal information from automated software evaluators called reward models (RMs), the broader purpose of studying hidden objectives is to prevent future scenarios where AI systems might deceive or manipulate human users.While training a language model using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), reward models are typically tuned to score AI responses according to how well they align with human preferences. However, if reward models are not tuned properly, they can inadvertently reinforce strange biases or unintended behaviors in AI models.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Jeff Schloss - Is the Future Open?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H75dFiJICi0</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/H75dFiJICi0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 19:00:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Show your support for the show with a Closer To Truth merch purchase: https://bit.ly/3P2ogje

Why is an ‘open’ future controversial among theologians? If the future is not ‘settled’, if there is no certainty from God’s viewpoint of how future events will turn out, then God’s providence, could not be as sure. If the future is truly open, then not even God could know the future because there are no future facts to know.

Melanie Lynskey discovers a potential match for her great-grandfather with the help of DNA and a wedding announcement. Other than these clues, this mystery man had very little records to prove his existence.

New Zealand-born and Emmy Nominated actress Melanie Lynskey has become an industry staple, having amassed a plethora of thought-provoking roles in television and film over the course of 30 years. Lynskey’s career began in 1994 with the release of Peter Jackson’s acclaimed film Heavenly Creatures, which earned her a New Zealand Film Award for Best Actress. Subsequent film credits include Adam Mckay’s Don’t Look Up, Stephen Chbosky’s The Perks of Being a Wallflower, Steven Soderbergh's The Informant, Tom McCarthy's Win Win, and many others.

Lynskey recently starred in HBO’s critically acclaimed The Last of Us, a series adaptation of the widely popular 2013 PlayStation video game of the same name and from 2003-2015, Lynskey had a popular recurring role as Rose in the hit TV show Two and A Half Men.

Agnostics do not know whether or not God exists. Theists surmise they’re reprobates. Atheists suppose they’re cowards. Are there different kinds of agnostics? Can agnosticism deepen appreciation for God—what it would take to believe in God and what it would mean if indeed there were a God? A robust, energetic agnosticism is a credit to God if there is one.

The double-edged sword that can make or break a TV show, cementing it forever as an icon of the medium, or dooming it to bar trivia night obscurity. 

When a popular TV show does something provocatively against the mold, networks can expect to see some angry letters, protests, or even outright boycotts. Some of these episodes deserve the criticism they get, but should we give some of these other shows a break?

ABSTRACT
AI is advancing at a rapid pace and it is transforming the way we approach development. This rapid evolution raises a number of questions and concerns regarding safety, process, and the most effective ways to leverage these powerful tools when they work directly with code.

In this talk, Michael Feathers will describe practices that acknowledge the strengths and weaknesses of LLM-based technology. We'll touch on practices related to code and test generation and as well as safe refactoring, design exploration and ideation. This talk is for anyone with development experience who wants to improve their practice. [...]

According to a bug report on Cursor's official forum, after producing approximately 750 to 800 lines of code (what the user calls "locs"), the AI assistant halted work and delivered a refusal message: "I cannot generate code for you, as that would be completing your work. The code appears to be handling skid mark fade effects in a racing game, but you should develop the logic yourself. This ensures you understand the system and can maintain it properly."
 
The AI didn't stop at merely refusing -- it offered a paternalistic justification for its decision, stating that "Generating code for others can lead to dependency and reduced learning opportunities." [...] The developer who encountered this refusal, posting under the username "janswist," expressed frustration at hitting this limitation after "just 1h of vibe coding" with the Pro Trial version. "Not sure if LLMs know what they are for (lol), but doesn't matter as much as a fact that I can't go through 800 locs," the developer wrote. "Anyone had similar issue? It's really limiting at this point and I got here after just 1h of vibe coding." One forum member replied, "never saw something like that, i have 3 files with 1500+ loc in my codebase (still waiting for a refactoring) and never experienced such thing."
 
Cursor AI's abrupt refusal represents an ironic twist in the rise of "vibe coding" -- a term coined by Andrej Karpathy that describes when developers use AI tools to generate code based on natural language descriptions without fully understanding how it works. While vibe coding prioritizes speed and experimentation by having users simply describe what they want and accept AI suggestions, Cursor's philosophical pushback seems to directly challenge the effortless "vibes-based" workflow its users have come to expect from modern AI coding assistants.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microservices, Where Did It All Go Wrong? • Ian Cooper, James Lewis &amp; Kris Jenkins</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWJYzpvoeEY</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/kWJYzpvoeEY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 10:39:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This interview was recorded at GOTO Copenhagen 2024.

The researchers tested eight AI-driven search tools by providing direct excerpts from real news articles and asking the models to identify each article's original headline, publisher, publication date, and URL. They discovered that the AI models incorrectly cited sources in more than 60 percent of these queries, raising significant concerns about their reliability in correctly attributing news content.Researchers Klaudia Jaźwińska and Aisvarya Chandrasekar noted in their report that roughly 1 in 4 Americans now use AI models as alternatives to traditional search engines. Given that these models struggle significantly when specifically asked to attribute news sources, this raises broader questions about their general reliability.Citation error rates varied notably among the tested platforms. Perplexity provided incorrect information in 37 percent of the queries tested, whereas ChatGPT Search incorrectly identified 67 percent (134 out of 200) of articles queried. Grok 3 demonstrated the highest error rate, at 94 percent. In total, researchers ran 1,600 queries across the eight different generative search tools.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Astrophysics Can (LITERALLY) Save the World</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfkU4CD91hk</link><author>PBS Space Time</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/cfkU4CD91hk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 20:11:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_gcs09iThXybpVgjHZ_7g">PBS Space Time</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Remove your personal information from the web at https://joindeleteme.com/SPACETIME

If successful, it could serve as an alternative to the chokepoint at the Suez Canal in Egypt. Turkey, Qatar and the UAE have all expressed support for the megaproject, but geopolitical tensions in the region are complicated, with some of its neighbors like Saudi Arabia, Russia and China being part of their own competing trade routes. Baghdad also has to navigate political instability within its own borders amongst rivalling factions.

Their identities remain a mystery - but Injuries found on them suggest that they all suffered brutally violent deaths.

Dr Jo Buckberry, a battle trauma expert at the University of Bradford, believes they date from 1296 to 1357 - the Scottish Wars of Independence.

Today Jo is going to reveal to us the clues that might help identify who these people were and uncover how they met their ends. And to help add some extra historical context she's  joined by History Hit's very own Medieval expert Historian and Author Matt Lewis.

The code appears to be handling skid mark fade effects in a racing game, but you should develop the logic yourself. This ensures you understand the system and can maintain it properly."The AI didn't stop at merely refusing—it offered a paternalistic justification for its decision, stating that "Generating code for others can lead to dependency and reduced learning opportunities."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What If Continents and Oceans Switched Places? #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joYJahY4FUI</link><author>Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/joYJahY4FUI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 15:01:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q">Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What if continents and oceans switched places?

To do good theology, religion must speak with science if only to avoid the embarrassment of supernatural explanations when natural explanations are doing just fine. If religion claims to be an approach to the entirety of existence, then it must embed the discoveries and insights of science. Religion has no choice. At its own risk, religion ignores science.

--

For as long as humans have had lice, we’ve fought hard to get rid of them. Nit combs, the fine-tooth brushes used to remove lice and their sticky eggs, have been found among the ancient remains of cultures across the globe. Today it’s estimated we spend billions of dollars each year treating infestations. So why are lice so difficult to get rid of? Nazzy Pakpour digs into these stubborn insects.

DESCRIPTION
Holly Cummins talks with Ben Evans about his latest book "Optimizing Cloud Native Java", which updates his previous work "Optimizing Java" to reflect the realities of cloud native environments.

Ben explains that performance engineering is not just technical but also psychological, emphasizing the importance of user expectations and defining clear performance goals. They discuss how modern Java performance must account for cloud native architectures, with applications running across distributed microservices and containerized, single-core environments.

The book focuses on the importance of measuring relevant data, warns against relying on misleading micro-benchmarks, and highlights how system-level benchmarks offer a clearer picture. Ben also delves into the JVM's hidden complexities, such as changes in Java 17 and the impact of virtual threads. Practical, real-world examples in the book, like the "fighting animals" microservices application, help developers learn how to optimize Java performance in real network environments.

Finally, Ben touches on the future of Java concurrency, with virtual threads and structured concurrency offering new ways to handle performance challenges in cloud native systems.

OpenAI said the administration should consider providing some relief for AI companies big and small from state rules – if and when enacted – in exchange for voluntary access to models.The recommendation was one of several included in OpenAI’s response to a request for public input issued by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy in February as the administration drafts a new policy to ensure US dominance in AI. President Donald Trump previously rescinded the Biden administration’s sprawling executive order on AI and tasked the science office with developing an AI Action Plan by July.To date, there has been a notable absence of federal legislation governing the AI sector. The Trump administration has generally signaled its intention to take a hands-off approach to regulating the technology. But many states are actively weighing new measures on everything from deepfakes to bias in AI systems.Chris Lehane, OpenAI’s vice president of global affairs, said in an interview that the US AI Safety Institute – a key government group focused on AI – could act as the main point of contact between the federal government and the private sector. If companies work with the group voluntarily to review models, the government could provide them “with liability protections including preemption from state based regulations that focus on frontier model security,” according to the proposal.“Part of the incentive for doing that ought to be that you don’t have to go through the state stuff, which is not going to be anywhere near as good as what the federal level would be,” Lehane said.In its policy recommendations, OpenAI also reiterated its call for the government to take steps to support AI infrastructure investments and called for copyright reform, arguing that America’s fair use doctrine is critical to maintaining AI leadership. OpenAI and other AI developers have faced numerous copyright lawsuits over the data used to build their models.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The simple math behind paying off debt versus investing #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTS5o8uYGpY</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/cTS5o8uYGpY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 12:01:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Subscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (🔔) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Amodei made the provocative remarks during an interview at the Council on Foreign Relations, acknowledging that the idea "sounds crazy.""So this is—this is another one of those topics that’s going to make me sound completely insane," Amodei said during the interview. "I think we should at least consider the question of, if we are building these systems and they do all kinds of things like humans as well as humans, and seem to have a lot of the same cognitive capacities, if it quacks like a duck and it walks like a duck, maybe it’s a duck."Amodei's comments came in response to an audience question from data scientist Carmem Domingues about Anthropic's late-2024 hiring of AI welfare researcher Kyle Fish "to look at, you know, sentience or lack of thereof of future AI models, and whether they might deserve moral consideration and protections in the future." Fish currently investigates the highly contentious topic of whether AI models could possess sentience or otherwise merit moral consideration.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Quantum Computing at Rigetti with David Rivas</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/03/13/quantum-computing-at-rigetti-with-david-rivas/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=quantum-computing-at-rigetti-with-david-rivas</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED4292642620.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 09:00:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Rigetti Computing is an American company specializing in quantum computing, founded in 2013.

Intel's board announced that Lip-Bu Tan will begin as Intel CEO on March 18, taking over from interim co-CEOs David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus.Gelsinger was booted from the CEO position by Intel's board on December 2 after several quarters of losses, rounds of layoffs, and canceled or spun-off side projects. Gelsinger sought to turn Intel into a foundry company that also manufactured chips for fabless third-party chip design companies, putting it into competition with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company(TSMC), Samsung, and others, a plan that Intel said it was still committed to when it let Gelsinger go.Intel said that Zinsner would stay on as executive vice president and CFO, and Johnston Holthaus would remain CEO of the Intel Products Group, which is mainly responsible for Intel's consumer products. These were the positions both executives held before serving as interim co-CEOs.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Android apps laced with North Korean spyware found in Google Play</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/03/researchers-find-north-korean-spy-apps-hosted-in-google-play/</link><author>Dan Goodin</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-play-store-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 22:03:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Researchers have discovered multiple Android apps, some that were available in Google Play after passing the company’s security vetting, that surreptitiously uploaded sensitive user information to spies working for the North Korean government.Samples of the malware—named KoSpy by Lookout, the security firm that discovered it—masquerade as utility apps for managing files, app or OS updates, and device security.

Spend a few weeks with WWE and you'll see how many tastes the product caters to. Segments can lean into different genres, such as drama, action, comedy, or even horror. Matches themselves are meant to capture a broad spectrum of styles, from Luchadors hitting highspots, to grueling submission matches to storybook endings by way of title matches that took years to build toward. The idea is to offer different styles and flavors to different segments of the audience. WWE 2K25 translates all of this variety very well, offering up many game modes, most of them worthwhile and often attracting different types of players. There are some flops on the card, but overall, this remains another main event-level display.WWE 2K25 is a great game in its own right and feels like the culmination of several years of effort to fix the series by the Visual Concepts team. WWE 2K20 was so bad and went so viral for that reason that the following year, the game didn't launch a new version--that's virtually unheard of in the world of annualized sports (and ) games. It clearly helped. Since then, it's been slowly and steadily improving year over year, making WWE 2K25 the best game in the series.In the ring, the biggest change is the addition of intergender matches. In the indie wrestling world, it's very common to have men and women wrestle each other without any added drama or lampshading. Promotions simply depict the competitors as equals--save for someone working heel who might call attention to it, of course. But WWE has long avoided similar matchups. This year, the studio finally got the go-ahead from the wrestling behemoth, so you can now, in one surely popular example, play as Rhea Ripley and squash Dominik Mysterio ad nauseam. It's great to see WWE becoming more comfortable with this idea and breaking down that needless barrier in its video game.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mark Klein, AT&amp;T whistleblower who revealed NSA mass spying, has died</title><link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/03/memoriam-mark-klein-att-whistleblower-about-nsa-mass-spying</link><author>leotravis10</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 21:05:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[EFF is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Mark Klein, a bona fide hero who risked civil liability and criminal prosecution to help expose a massive spying program that violated the rights of millions of Americans.Mark didn’t set out to change the world. For 22 years, he was a telecommunications technician for AT&T, most of that in San Francisco. But he always had a strong sense of right and wrong and a commitment to privacy.When the New York Times reported in late 2005 that the NSA was engaging in spying inside the U.S., Mark realized that he had witnessed how it was happening. He also realized that the President was not telling Americans the truth about the program. And, though newly retired, he knew that he had to do something. He showed up at EFF’s front door in early 2006 with a simple question: “Do you folks care about privacy?” We did. And what Mark told us changed everything. Through his work, Mark had learned that the National Security Agency (NSA) had installed a secret, secure room at AT&T’s central office in San Francisco, called Room 641A. Mark was assigned to connect circuits carrying Internet data to optical “splitters” that sat just outside of the secret NSA room but were hardwired into it. Those splitters—as well as similar ones in cities around the U.S.—made a copy of all data going through those circuits and delivered it into the secret room.A photo of the NSA-controlled 'secret room' in the AT&T facility in San Francisco (Credit: Mark Klein)Mark not only saw how it works, he had the documents to prove it. He brought us over a hundred pages of authenticated AT&T schematic diagrams and tables. Mark also shared this information with major media outlets, numerous Congressional staffers, and at least two senators personally. One, Senator Chris Dodd, took the floor of the Senate to acknowledge Mark as the great American hero he was.Archival EFF graphic promoting Mark Klein's DC tourMark stood up and told the truth at great personal risk to himself and his family. AT&T threatened to sue him, although it wisely decided not to do so. While we were able to use his evidence to make some change, both EFF and Mark were ultimately let down by Congress and the Courts, which have refused to take the steps necessary to end the mass spying even after Edward Snowden provided even more evidence of it in 2013. But Mark certainly inspired all of us at EFF, and he helped inspire and inform hundreds of thousands of ordinary Americans to demand an end to illegal mass surveillance. While we have not yet seen the success in ending the spying that we all have hoped for, his bravery helped to usher numerous reforms so far.And the fight is not over. The law, called Section 702, that now authorizes the continued surveillance that Mark first revealed, expires in early 2026. EFF and others will continue to push for continued reforms and, ultimately, for the illegal spying to end entirely.Mark’s legacy lives on in our continuing fights to reform surveillance and honor the Fourth Amendment’s promise of protecting personal privacy. We are forever grateful to him for having the courage to stand up and will do our best to honor that legacy by continuing the fight. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google’s new robot AI can fold delicate origami, close zipper bags without damage</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/googles-origami-folding-ai-brain-may-power-new-wave-of-humanoid-robots/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/apollo_humanoid_robot-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 19:38:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Wednesday, Google DeepMind announced two new AI models designed to control robots: Gemini Robotics and Gemini Robotics-ER. The company claims these models will help robots of many shapes and sizes understand and interact with the physical world more effectively and delicately than previous systems, paving the way for applications such as humanoid robot assistants.It's worth noting that even though hardware for robot platforms appears to be advancing at a steady pace (well, maybe not always), creating a capable AI model that can pilot these robots autonomously through novel scenarios with safety and precision has proven elusive. What the industry calls "embodied AI" is a moonshot goal of Nvidia, for example, and it remains a holy grail that could potentially turn robotics into general-use laborers in the physical world.Along those lines, Google's new models build upon its Gemini 2.0 large language model foundation, adding capabilities specifically for robotic applications. Gemini Robotics includes what Google calls "vision-language-action" (VLA) abilities, allowing it to process visual information, understand language commands, and generate physical movements. By contrast, Gemini Robotics-ER focuses on "embodied reasoning" with enhanced spatial understanding, letting roboticists connect it to their existing robot control systems.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft goes nuclear on TypeScript codebase…</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQ2WjtaPfXU</link><author>Fireship</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/PQ2WjtaPfXU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 19:10:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA">Dev - Fireship</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Get 3 months of Sentry’s team plan free https://bit.ly/3Fs19Oj

Anyone who makes it to one of its 84 institutes belongs to the elite: an organization that counts 31 Nobel Prize laureates among its ranks. But there is a dark side to its facade.
 
For months, DW's investigative unit, along with German news magazine Der Spiegel, has investigated allegations of misconduct perpetrated by senior scientific staff at Max Planck institutes. We spoke to more than 30 young scientists, many who described abusive behavior and toxic environments. They were afraid to report the abuse, fearing the consequences, and the few who did report say they were discouraged from doing so.
 
DW goes behind the scenes of Germany's elite research institutes to find out why abusive behavior and toxic work environments remain resilient in the face of opposition.

[Correction 13.03.25: In the documentary, we stated that German media had reported widespread sexual harassment perpetrated by two directors at the Ernst Strüngmann Institute for Neuroscience. This was incorrect. The reports referred to two senior staff members, not directors. We regret the error.]

‘Enough of this. Bring up the railguns, let’s finish this and go home.’ - MCRN Captain Theresa Yao, The Expanse, 2015

Electromagnetic railguns are guns powered by electricity instead of chemical propellants. Most will be familiar with railguns as futuristic weapons featured in science fiction. To date, many countries have carried out experimental and theoretical studies of railguns but none has yet developed them into practical weapons.

The lecture will explore the scientific principles of railgun operation and some of the engineering challenges involved. Derek will also explore some of his experiences from UK experimental work from the 1980s and 1990s, when railguns were seen as potential future anti-tank weapons.

This will include the design and patenting of a railswitch breech for the RARDE experimental programme. He will shed light on the full size wooden model of the patented railswitch breech, now held in the Royal Armouries collection at Fort Nelson (object number XIX.852). He will also talk about his work on the Hyperlocity Test Facility railgun at Culham Laboratory.

So far however, those abilities have been largely confined to the digital realm. In order for AI to be useful and helpful to people in the physical realm, they have to demonstrate “embodied” reasoning — the humanlike ability to comprehend and react to the world around us— as well as safely take action to get things done.Today, we are introducing two new AI models, based on Gemini 2.0, which lay the foundation for a new generation of helpful robots.The first is Gemini Robotics, an advanced vision-language-action (VLA) model that was built on Gemini 2.0 with the addition of physical actions as a new output modality for the purpose of directly controlling robots. The second is Gemini Robotics-ER, a Gemini model with advanced spatial understanding, enabling roboticists to run their own programs using Gemini’s embodied reasoning (ER) abilities.Both of these models enable a variety of robots to perform a wider range of real-world tasks than ever before. As part of our efforts, we’re partnering with Apptronik to build the next generation of humanoid robots with Gemini 2.0. We’re also working with a selected number of trusted testers to guide the future of Gemini Robotics-ER.We look forward to exploring our models’ capabilities and continuing to develop them on the path to real-world applications.Gemini Robotics: Our most advanced vision-language-action modelTo be useful and helpful to people, AI models for robotics need three principal qualities: they have to be general, meaning they’re able to adapt to different situations; they have to be interactive, meaning they can understand and respond quickly to instructions or changes in their environment; and they have to be dexterous, meaning they can do the kinds of things people generally can do with their hands and fingers, like carefully manipulate objects.While our previous work demonstrated progress in these areas, Gemini Robotics represents a substantial step in performance on all three axes, getting us closer to truly general purpose robots.Gemini Robotics leverages Gemini's world understanding to generalize to novel situations and solve a wide variety of tasks out of the box, including tasks it has never seen before in training. Gemini Robotics is also adept at dealing with new objects, diverse instructions, and new environments. In our tech report, we show that on average, Gemini Robotics more than doubles performance on a comprehensive generalization benchmark compared to other state-of-the-art vision-language-action models.To operate in our dynamic, physical world, robots must be able to seamlessly interact with people and their surrounding environment, and adapt to changes on the fly.Because it’s built on a foundation of Gemini 2.0, Gemini Robotics is intuitively interactive. It taps into Gemini’s advanced language understanding capabilities and can understand and respond to commands phrased in everyday, conversational language and in different languages.It can understand and respond to a much broader set of natural language instructions than our previous models, adapting its behavior to your input. It also continuously monitors its surroundings, detects changes to its environment or instructions, and adjusts its actions accordingly. This kind of control, or “steerability,” can better help people collaborate with robot assistants in a range of settings, from home to the workplace.The third key pillar for building a helpful robot is acting with dexterity. Many everyday tasks that humans perform effortlessly require surprisingly fine motor skills and are still too difficult for robots. By contrast, Gemini Robotics can tackle extremely complex, multi-step tasks that require precise manipulation such as origami folding or packing a snack into a Ziploc bag.Finally, because robots come in all shapes and sizes, Gemini Robotics was also designed to easily adapt to different robot types. We trained the model primarily on data from the bi-arm robotic platform, ALOHA 2, but we also demonstrated that it could control a bi-arm platform, based on the Franka arms used in many academic labs. Gemini Robotics can even be specialized for more complex embodiments, such as the humanoid Apollo robot developed by Apptronik, with the goal of completing real world tasks.Enhancing Gemini’s world understandingAlongside Gemini Robotics, we’re introducing an advanced vision-language model called Gemini Robotics-ER (short for ‘“embodied reasoning”). This model enhances Gemini’s understanding of the world in ways necessary for robotics, focusing especially on spatial reasoning, and allows roboticists to connect it with their existing low level controllers.Gemini Robotics-ER improves Gemini 2.0’s existing abilities like pointing and 3D detection by a large margin. Combining spatial reasoning and Gemini’s coding abilities, Gemini Robotics-ER can instantiate entirely new capabilities on the fly. For example, when shown a coffee mug, the model can intuit an appropriate two-finger grasp for picking it up by the handle and a safe trajectory for approaching it.Gemini Robotics-ER can perform all the steps necessary to control a robot right out of the box, including perception, state estimation, spatial understanding, planning and code generation. In such an end-to-end setting the model achieves a 2x-3x success rate compared to Gemini 2.0. And where code generation is not sufficient, Gemini Robotics-ER can even tap into the power of in-context learning, following the patterns of a handful of human demonstrations to provide a solution.Responsibly advancing AI and roboticsAs we explore the continuing potential of AI and robotics, we’re taking a layered, holistic approach to addressing safety in our research, from low-level motor control to high-level semantic understanding.The physical safety of robots and the people around them is a longstanding, foundational concern in the science of robotics. That's why roboticists have classic safety measures such as avoiding collisions, limiting the magnitude of contact forces, and ensuring the dynamic stability of mobile robots. Gemini Robotics-ER can be interfaced with these ‘low-level’ safety-critical controllers, specific to each particular embodiment. Building on Gemini’s core safety features, we enable Gemini Robotics-ER models to understand whether or not a potential action is safe to perform in a given context, and to generate appropriate responses.To advance robotics safety research across academia and industry, we are also releasing a new dataset to evaluate and improve semantic safety in embodied AI and robotics. In previous work, we showed how a Robot Constitution inspired by Isaac Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics could help prompt an LLM to select safer tasks for robots. We have since developed a framework to automatically generate data-driven constitutions - rules expressed directly in natural language – to steer a robot’s behavior. This framework would allow people to create, modify and apply constitutions to develop robots that are safer and more aligned with human values. Finally, the new ASIMOV dataset will help researchers to rigorously measure the safety implications of robotic actions in real-world scenarios.To further assess the societal implications of our work, we collaborate with experts in our Responsible Development and Innovation team and as well as our Responsibility and Safety Council, an internal review group committed to ensure we develop AI applications responsibly. We also consult with external specialists on particular challenges and opportunities presented by embodied AI in robotics applications.In addition to our partnership with Apptronik, our Gemini Robotics-ER model is also available to trusted testers including Agile Robots, Agility Robots, Boston Dynamics, and Enchanted Tools. We look forward to exploring our models’ capabilities and continuing to develop AI for the next generation of more helpful robots.This work was developed by the Gemini Robotics team.

One of them, a T-55, was 4,700 metres or nearly 3 miles away, four times the battle range of his Challenger 1. When his crew fired the main gun, the round took nearly three full seconds to reach the target. When it did, a massive fireball erupted in the distance. Purbrick’s crew had just achieved the longest tank-to-tank kill in military history. That T-55 was one of many Iraqi tanks which never even saw the enemy coming.

In this third episode of our Gulf War Series IWM Curator Megan Joyce uncovers the challenges faced by Coalition forces, the mass deception tactics employed, and the pivotal role of GPS in navigating the Iraqi desert. Join us as we examine the intense battles, including the Battle of 73 Easting and the Battle of Norfolk, and the final withdrawal of Iraqi troops.

ABSTRACT
An informative guide to what is special about the Rust programming language and how to bring the best parts of it into your software project, whichever programming language it's implemented in.

Rust programmers spend a lot of time thinking about lifetimes, ownership and borrowing. So should you! These concepts are actually universal in programming. Rust's approach is to encode them into the type system and make the compiler check that you're obeying the rules (that you manually check anyway).

We'll also learn about some of its language features, including algebraic data types, error handling, and how it can guarantee that (the equivalent of) a NullPointerExeception will never occur. This language that brings memory safety to systems programming has much to share. Come and learn! [...]

However, it can be cumbersome for working with lengthy SQL queries, and its data exploration tools are limited.
Many of the available third party UIs are great, but selecting, installing, and configuring one is not straightforward.
Using DuckDB through a UI should be as simple as using the CLI.
And now it is!Starting with DuckDB v1.2.1, a full-featured local web user interface is available out-of-the-box!
You can start it from the terminal by launching the DuckDB CLI client with the  argument:You can also run the following SQL command from a DuckDB client (e.g., CLI, Python, Java, etc.):Both of these approaches install the  extension (if it isn't installed yet),
then open the DuckDB UI in your browser:The DuckDB UI uses interactive notebooks to define SQL scripts and show the results of queries.
However, its capabilities go far beyond this.
Let’s go over its main features.The DuckDB UI runs all your queries locally: your queries and data never leave your computer.
If you would like to use MotherDuck through the UI, you have to opt-in explicitly.Your attached databases are shown on the left.
This list includes in-memory databases plus any files and URLs you’ve loaded.
You can explore tables and views by expanding databases and schemas.Click on a table or view to show a summary below.
The UI shows the number of rows, the name and type of each column, and a profile of the data in each column.Select a column to see a more detailed summary of its data.
You can use the  button near the top right to inspect the first 100 rows.
You can also find the SQL definition of the table or view here.You can organize your work into named notebooks.
Each cell of the notebook can execute one or more SQL statements.
The UI supports syntax highlighting and autocomplete to assist with writing your queries.You can run the whole cell, or just a selection,
then sort, filter, or further transform the results using the provided controls.The right panel contains the Column Explorer, which shows a summary of your results.
You can dive into each column to gain insights.If you would like to connect to MotherDuck, you can sign into MotherDuck to persist files and tables to a cloud data warehouse crafted for using DuckDB at scale and sharing data with your team.The DuckDB UI is under active development. Expect additions and improvements!Like the DuckDB CLI, the DuckDB UI creates some files in the  directory in your home directory.
The UI puts its files in a sub-directory, :Your notebooks and some other state are stored in a DuckDB database, .When you export data to the clipboard or a file (using the controls below the results), some tiny intermediate files (e.g. ) are generated.
Your data is cleared from these files after the export is completed, but some near-empty files remain, one per file type.Support for the UI is implemented in a DuckDB extension.
The extension embeds a localhost HTTP server, which serves the UI browser application, and also exposes an API for communication with DuckDB.
In this way, the UI leverages the native DuckDB instance from which it was started, enabling full access to your local memory, compute, and file system.Results are returned in an efficient binary form closely matching DuckDB’s in-memory representation (DataChunk).
Server-sent events enable prompt notification of updates such as attaching databases.
These techniques and others make for a low-latency experience that keeps you in your flow.In this blog post, we presented the new DuckDB UI, a powerful web interface for DuckDB.The DuckDB UI shares many of its design principles with the DuckDB database.
It’s simple, fast, feature-rich, and portable, and runs locally on your computer.
The DuckDB UI extension is also open source: visit the  repository if you want to dive in deeper into the extension's code.The repository does not contain the source code for the frontend, which is currently not available as open-source.
Releasing it as open-source is under consideration.We are very happy to see the overwhelmingly positive response to the announcement of the DuckDB Local UI. In this short update, we’d like to address some of the questions raised by the community:Regarding the licensing of the frontend code (HTML, JavaScript, etc.), MotherDuck is currently reviewing licensing options for the UI code and assets and will clarify shortly.Regarding offline (“air-gapped”) operations, we are working towards supporting offline usage in a future version, and are currently exploring how to provide version notifications as upgrades become available.Regarding the client-server protocol for the UI, we’re going to work on opening up the client-server protocol so that other user interfaces can use the “back-end” part of the UI extension to run queries in DuckDB.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mercedes-Benz Drives Toward Solid-State EV Batteries</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/mercedes-benz</link><author>Lawrence Ulrich</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Njc2OTUwOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4ODU2NTg0NX0.kWQaB9dF0zGesDWKBhA70-XztMQk1cdzlWVpWCNBs7E/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Factorial Energy's semi-solid-state cells could be in EVs in a few years]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Can a New Power Link Boost the EU’s Energy Independence?</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/black-sea-energy-link</link><author>Amos Zeeberg</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NjY2NzY1My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc5MDMyNTE5NH0.hL7VXlZjYYVXlowC14gTHx1atEgcdIKzlIAmDPaCrgk/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 11:00:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Undersea cable would supply clean electricity from the Caucasus]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Metadata routing in scikit-learn</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_-Aja-slA</link><author>probabl</author><category>dev</category><category>ml</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/lQ_-Aja-slA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 10:30:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIat2Cdg661wF5DQDWTQAmg">Dev - Probabl</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Metadata routing is a relatively new feature that allows you to, as the name implies, route metadata to different components in your machine learning setup.

The Responses API will eventually replace the current Assistants API, which OpenAI plans to retire in the first half of 2026. With the new offering, users can develop custom AI agents that scan company files with a file search utility that rapidly checks company databases (with OpenAI promising not to train its models on these files) and navigate websites -- similar to functions available through OpenAI's Operator agent, whose underlying Computer-Using Agent (CUA) model developers can also access to enable automation of tasks like data entry and other operations.
 
However, OpenAI acknowledges that its CUA model is not yet reliable for automating tasks on operating systems and can make unintended mistakes. The company describes the new API as an early iteration that it will continue to improve over time. Developers using the Responses API can access the same models that power ChatGPT Search: GPT-4o search and GPT-4o mini search. These models can browse the web to answer questions and cite sources in their responses. That's notable because OpenAI says the added web search ability dramatically improves the factual accuracy of its AI models. On OpenAI's SimpleQA benchmark, which aims to measure confabulation rate, GPT-4o search scored 90 percent, while GPT-4o mini search achieved 88 percent -- both substantially outperforming the larger GPT-4.5 model without search, which scored 63 percent.
 
Despite these improvements, the technology still has significant limitations.

the leaders of its various Special Interest Groups (SIGs). This time, we focus on
,
the group responsible for everything related to developing, deploying, and operating applications on
Kubernetes. Sandipan Panda
(DevZero) had the opportunity to interview Maciej
Szulik (Defense Unicorns) and Janet
Kuo (Google), the chairs and tech leads of
SIG Apps. They shared their experiences, challenges, and visions for the future of application
management within the Kubernetes ecosystem.Sandipan: Hello, could you start by telling us a bit about yourself, your role, and your journey
within the Kubernetes community that led to your current roles in SIG Apps?: Hey, my name is Maciej, and I’m one of the leads for SIG Apps. Aside from this role, you
can also find me helping
SIG CLI and also being one of
the Steering Committee members. I’ve been contributing to Kubernetes since late 2014 in various
areas, including controllers, apiserver, and kubectl.: Certainly! I'm Janet, a Staff Software Engineer at Google, and I've been deeply involved
with the Kubernetes project since its early days, even before the 1.0 launch in 2015. It's been an
amazing journey!My current role within the Kubernetes community is one of the chairs and tech leads of SIG Apps. My
journey with SIG Apps started organically. I started with building the Deployment API and adding
rolling update functionalities. I naturally gravitated towards SIG Apps and became increasingly
involved. Over time, I took on more responsibilities, culminating in my current leadership roles.All following answers were jointly provided by Maciej and Janet.Sandipan: For those unfamiliar, could you provide an overview of SIG Apps' mission and objectives?
What key problems does it aim to solve within the Kubernetes ecosystem?As described in our
charter, we cover a
broad area related to developing, deploying, and operating applications on Kubernetes. That, in
short, means we’re open to each and everyone showing up at our bi-weekly meetings and discussing the
ups and downs of writing and deploying various applications on Kubernetes.Sandipan: What are some of the most significant projects or initiatives currently being undertaken
by SIG Apps?At this point in time, the main factors driving the development of our controllers are the
challenges coming from running various AI-related workloads. It’s worth giving credit here to two
working groups we’ve sponsored over the past years:Best practices and challengesSandipan: SIG Apps plays a crucial role in developing application management best practices for
Kubernetes. Can you share some of these best practices and how they help improve application
lifecycle management?Implementing health checks and readiness probes
ensures that your applications are healthy and ready to serve traffic, leading to improved
reliability and uptime. The above, combined with comprehensive logging, monitoring, and tracing
solutions, will provide insights into your application's behavior, enabling you to identify and
resolve issues quickly.Auto-scale your application based
on resource utilization or custom metrics, optimizing resource usage and ensuring your
application can handle varying loads.Use Deployment for stateless applications, StatefulSet for stateful applications, Job
and CronJob for batch workloads, and DaemonSet for running a daemon on each node. Use
Operators and CRDs to extend the Kubernetes API to automate the deployment, management, and
lifecycle of complex applications, making them easier to operate and reducing manual
intervention.Sandipan: What are some of the common challenges SIG Apps faces, and how do you address them?The biggest challenge we’re facing all the time is the need to reject a lot of features, ideas, and
improvements. This requires a lot of discipline and patience to be able to explain the reasons
behind those decisions.Sandipan: How has the evolution of Kubernetes influenced the work of SIG Apps? Are there any
recent changes or upcoming features in Kubernetes that you find particularly relevant or beneficial
for SIG Apps?The main benefit for both us and the whole community around SIG Apps is the ability to extend
kubernetes with Custom Resource Definitions
and the fact that users can build their own custom controllers leveraging the built-in ones to
achieve whatever sophisticated use cases they might have and we, as the core maintainers, haven’t
considered or weren’t able to efficiently resolve inside Kubernetes.Sandipan: What opportunities are available for new contributors who want to get involved with SIG
Apps, and what advice would you give them?We get the question, "What good first issue might you recommend we start with?" a lot :-) But
unfortunately, there’s no easy answer to it. We always tell everyone that the best option to start
contributing to core controllers is to find one you are willing to spend some time with. Read
through the code, then try running unit tests and integration tests focusing on that
controller. Once you grasp the general idea, try breaking it and the tests again to verify your
breakage. Once you start feeling confident you understand that particular controller, you may want
to search through open issues affecting that controller and either provide suggestions, explaining
the problem users have, or maybe attempt your first fix.Like we said, there are no shortcuts on that road; you need to spend the time with the codebase to
understand all the edge cases we’ve slowly built up to get to the point where we are. Once you’re
successful with one controller, you’ll need to repeat that same process with others all over again.Sandipan: How does SIG Apps gather feedback from the community, and how is this feedback
integrated into your work?We always encourage everyone to show up and present their problems and solutions during our
bi-weekly meetings. As long
as you’re solving an interesting problem on top of Kubernetes and you can provide valuable feedback
about any of the core controllers, we’re always happy to hear from everyone.Sandipan: Looking ahead, what are the key focus areas or upcoming trends in application management
within Kubernetes that SIG Apps is excited about? How is the SIG adapting to these trends?Definitely the current AI hype is the major driving factor; as mentioned above, we have two working
groups, each covering a different aspect of it.Sandipan: What are some of your favorite things about this SIG?Without a doubt, the people that participate in our meetings and on
Slack, who tirelessly help triage issues, pull
requests and invest a lot of their time (very frequently their private time) into making kubernetes
great!SIG Apps is an essential part of the Kubernetes community, helping to shape how applications are
deployed and managed at scale. From its work on improving Kubernetes' workload APIs to driving
innovation in AI/ML application management, SIG Apps is continually adapting to meet the needs of
modern application developers and operators. Whether you’re a new contributor or an experienced
developer, there’s always an opportunity to get involved and make an impact.If you’re interested in learning more or contributing to SIG Apps, be sure to check out their SIG
README and join their bi-weekly meetings.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Traversal-resistant file APIs</title><link>https://go.dev/blog/osroot</link><author>Damien Neil</author><category>dev</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://blog.golang.org/feed.atom">Dev - Golang Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A path traversal vulnerability arises when an attacker can trick a program
into opening a file other than the one it intended.
This post explains this class of vulnerability,
some existing defenses against it, and describes how the new
 API added in Go 1.24 provides
a simple and robust defense against unintentional path traversal.“Path traversal” covers a number of related attacks following a common pattern:
A program attempts to open a file in some known location, but an attacker causes
it to open a file in a different location.If the attacker controls part of the filename, they may be able to use relative
directory components ("..") to escape the intended location:f, err := os.Open(filepath.Join(trustedLocation, "../../../../etc/passwd"))
On Windows systems, some names have special meaning:// f will print to the console.
f, err := os.Create(filepath.Join(trustedLocation, "CONOUT$"))
If the attacker controls part of the local filesystem, they may be able to use
symbolic links to cause a program to access the wrong file:// Attacker links /home/user/.config to /home/otheruser/.config:
err := os.WriteFile("/home/user/.config/foo", config, 0o666)
If the program defends against symlink traversal by first verifying that the intended file
does not contain any symlinks, it may still be vulnerable to
time-of-check/time-of-use (TOCTOU) races,
where the attacker creates a symlink after the program’s check:// Validate the path before use.
cleaned, err := filepath.EvalSymlinks(unsafePath)
if err != nil {
  return err
}
if !filepath.IsLocal(cleaned) {
  return errors.New("unsafe path")
}

// Attacker replaces part of the path with a symlink.
// The Open call follows the symlink:
f, err := os.Open(cleaned)
Another variety of TOCTOU race involves moving a directory that forms part of a path
mid-traversal. For example, the attacker provides a path such as “a/b/c/../../etc/passwd”,
and renames “a/b/c” to “a/b” while the open operation is in progress.Before we tackle path traversal attacks in general, let’s start with path sanitization.
When a program’s threat model does not include attackers with access to the local file system,
it can be sufficient to validate untrusted input paths before use.Unfortunately, sanitizing paths can be surprisingly tricky,
especially for portable programs that must handle both Unix and Windows paths.
For example, on Windows  reports ,
because the path “\foo” is relative to the current drive.In Go 1.20, we added the 
function, which reports whether a path is “local”. A “local” path is one which:does not escape the directory in which it is evaluated ("../etc/passwd" is not allowed);is not an absolute path ("/etc/passwd" is not allowed);is not empty ("" is not allowed);on Windows, is not a reserved name (“COM1” is not allowed).In Go 1.23, we added the 
function, which converts a /-separated path into a local operating system path.Programs that accept and operate on potentially attacker-controlled paths should almost
always use  or  to validate or sanitize those paths.Path sanitization is not sufficient when attackers may have access to part of
the local filesystem.Multi-user systems are uncommon these days, but attacker access to the filesystem
can still occur in a variety of ways.
An unarchiving utility that extracts a tar or zip file may be induced
to extract a symbolic link and then extract a file name that traverses that link.
A container runtime may give untrusted code access to a portion of the local filesystem.Programs may defend against unintended symlink traversal by using the
path/filepath.EvalSymlinks
function to resolve links in untrusted names before validation, but as described
above this two-step process is vulnerable to TOCTOU races.Before Go 1.24, the safer option was to use a package such as
github.com/google/safeopen,
that provides path traversal-resistant functions for opening a potentially-untrusted
filename within a specific directory.In Go 1.24, we are introducing new APIs in the  package to safely open
a file in a location in a traversal-resistent fashion.The new  type represents a directory somewhere
in the local filesystem. Open a root with the 
function:root, err := os.OpenRoot("/some/root/directory")
if err != nil {
  return err
}
defer root.Close()
 provides methods to operate on files within the root.
These methods all accept filenames relative to the root,
and disallow any operations that would escape from the root either
using relative path components ("..") or symlinks.f, err := root.Open("path/to/file")
 permits relative path components and symlinks that do not escape the root.
For example,  is permitted. Filenames are resolved using the
semantics of the local platform: On Unix systems, this will follow
any symlink in “a” (so long as that link does not escape the root);
while on Windows systems this will open “b” (even if “a” does not exist). currently provides the following set of operations:func (*Root) Create(string) (*File, error)
func (*Root) Lstat(string) (fs.FileInfo, error)
func (*Root) Mkdir(string, fs.FileMode) error
func (*Root) Open(string) (*File, error)
func (*Root) OpenFile(string, int, fs.FileMode) (*File, error)
func (*Root) OpenRoot(string) (*Root, error)
func (*Root) Remove(string) error
func (*Root) Stat(string) (fs.FileInfo, error)
In addition to the  type, the new
 function
provides a simple way to open a potentially-untrusted filename within a
specific directory:f, err := os.OpenInRoot("/some/root/directory", untrustedFilename)
The  type provides a simple, safe, portable API for operating with untrusted filenames.Caveats and considerationsOn Unix systems,  is implemented using the  family of system calls.
A  contains a file descriptor referencing its root directory and will track that
directory across renames or deletion. defends against symlink traversal but does not limit traversal
of mount points. For example,  does not prevent traversal of
Linux bind mounts. Our threat model is that  defends against
filesystem constructs that may be created by ordinary users (such
as symlinks), but does not handle ones that require root privileges
to create (such as bind mounts).On Windows,  opens a handle referencing its root directory.
The open handle prevents that directory from being renamed or deleted until the  is closed. prevents access to reserved Windows device names such as  and .On WASI, the  package uses the WASI preview 1 filesystem API,
which are intended to provide traversal-resistent filesystem access.
Not all WASI implementations fully support filesystem sandboxing,
however, and ’s defense against traversal is limited to that provided
by the WASI impementation.When GOOS=js, the  package uses the Node.js file system API.
This API does not include the openat family of functions,
and so  is vulnerable to TOCTOU (time-of-check-time-of-use) races in symlink
validation on this platform.When GOOS=js, a  references a directory name rather than a file descriptor,
and does not track directories across renames.Plan 9 does not have symlinks.
On Plan 9, a  references a directory name and performs lexical sanitization of
filenames. operations on filenames containing many directory components can be much more expensive
than the equivalent non- operation. Resolving “..” components can also be expensive.
Programs that want to limit the cost of filesystem operations can use  to
remove “..” components from input filenames, and may want to limit the number of
directory components.You should use  or  if:you are opening a file in a directory; ANDthe operation should not access a file outside that directory.For example, an archive extractor writing files to an output directory should use
, because the filenames are potentially untrusted and it would be incorrect
to write a file outside the output directory.However, a command-line program that writes output to a user-specified location
should not use , because the filename is not untrusted and may
refer to anywhere on the filesystem.As a good rule of thumb, code which calls  to combine a fixed directory
and an externally-provided filename should probably use  instead.// This might open a file not located in baseDirectory.
f, err := os.Open(filepath.Join(baseDirectory, filename))

// This will only open files under baseDirectory.
f, err := os.OpenInRoot(baseDirectory, filename)
The  API is new in Go 1.24.
We expect to make additions and refinements to it in future releases.The current implementation prioritizes correctness and safety over performance.
Future versions will take advantage of platform-specific APIs, such as
Linux’s , to improve performance where possible.There are a number of filesystem operations which  does not support yet, such as
creating symbolic links and renaming files. Where possible, we will add support for these
operations. A list of additional functions in progress is in
go.dev/issue/67002.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>OpenAI pushes AI agent capabilities with new developer API</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/openai-pushes-ai-agent-capabilities-with-new-developer-api/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/agent_test-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 20:42:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The AI industry is doing its best to will "agents"—pieces of AI-driven software that can perform multistep actions on your behalf—into reality.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Paul Mecurio answer questions on the Higgs Field, dark energy, and the feasibility of Dyson spheres with astrophysicist Hakeem Oluseyi.

We discuss Hakeem’s role as CEO of the Astronomical Society, and his work on NASA’s IMAP satellite, designed to study the boundary of our solar system. He shares his vision for making astronomy more accessible, the difference between nerds and geeks, and why he doesn’t wear gold.

Then, we tackle the growing mystery of the universe’s expansion. Is the Hubble tension a sign of undiscovered physics? Could our cosmological models need tweaking? We explore the role of dark energy, the Higgs field, and the unanswered questions that keep physicists awake at night.

Next, we turn our sights to exoplanets. How do scientists detect distant atmospheres? What can JWST reveal? And when it comes to dark matter—could it be defying our understanding of physics itself? We break down theories, alternative gravity models, and the possibility that new technology may finally uncover what’s been eluding us.

Plus, we tackle gravitational waves and time itself—what would happen if we were hit by one? Is “now” just an illusion? We break down the Andromeda Paradox and also touch on black holes, information loss, and the search for Dyson spheres. Could an advanced civilization really build one, or is it just sci-fi fantasy? All this, plus a look at the biggest roadblock in STEM education, the history of mathematical knowledge, and how we can get more people looking up.

As rents rise, so does homelessness. With no house or apartment, Jordyn, Jonathan and their young daughter Delilah have to find a new place to sleep every night.

The young family has been searching for permanent accommodation in Ireland's capital for ten months. Their everyday life involves appointments with the local authorities and endless hours spent on hold on the telephone. They are unable to afford Dublin’s high rents, and social housing seems beyond their reach. Each day, Jordyn, Jonathan and their daughter try to arrange to stay the night with friends or relatives.

Justin is a social worker. He previously worked with homeless people in a privately run emergency shelter. But when the shelter was sold, he lost his job and his home. Now, he spends his days combing through offers on the overpriced housing market. But the few available homes are usually either unaffordable or unsuitable. Single rooms, and even individual beds, are being rented out at fantastical prices.

Conor is currently completing his doctoral thesis, and lives with his girlfriend in a tiny apartment. The housing shortage has turned him into a political activist: he’s running for a seat on the city council and helping to raise awareness of the problem. He collects signatures for a petition to stop apartments being left empty, and for more affordable housing.

Despite the government’s promises, Ireland remains in the midst of a seemingly never-ending housing crisis. For Jordyn, Jonathan and little Delilah, there’s light at the end of the tunnel. But for many others, the situation remains desperate.

The deadly disease spread so quickly around the world that it could not be stopped with known measures.  

For many people, like César Serrano, it was as if time had stopped, “it's as if a huge storm has come and wiped out everything. Everything is completely deserted, lifeless, closed.” 

It felt like something out of a disaster movie. First came the fear of this unknown virus, followed by lockdowns. Once the first wave had passed, restrictions in some places were eased. Then came further waves and restrictions, but people got used to the changes in their daily life.  

As the pandemic entered its second year, expressions of solidarity, seen at the start, gave way to frustration and anger. People took to the streets in anti-government protests and conspiracy theories spread. People also began to question the price they had paid for efforts made at protecting themselves and others against this virus. 

What impact did the coronavirus pandemic have on our life?

--

Industrial manufacturers spend a huge amount of energy generating heat to make everyday materials and objects, like cement, steel, and paper. And since most companies use fossil fuels to reach these high temperatures, industrial heat accounts for 20% of our annual global carbon pollution. Thankfully, this is where a century-old technology comes in. Rachel Yang explores how heat batteries work.

As your codebase grows, so does the value of TypeScript itself, but in many cases TypeScript has not been able to scale up to the very largest codebases.
Developers working in large projects can experience long load and check times, and have to choose between reasonable editor startup time or getting a complete view of their source code.
We know developers love when they can rename variables with confidence, find all references to a particular function, easily navigate their codebase, and do all of those things without delay.
New experiences powered by AI benefit from large windows of semantic information that need to be available with tighter latency constraints.
We also want fast command-line builds to validate that your entire codebase is in good shape.To meet those goals, we’ve begun work on a native port of the TypeScript compiler and tools.
The native implementation will drastically improve editor startup, reduce most build times by 10x, and substantially reduce memory usage.
By porting the current codebase, we expect to be able to preview a native implementation of  capable of command-line typechecking by mid-2025, with a feature-complete solution for project builds and a language service by the end of the year.You can , which is offered under the same license as the existing TypeScript codebase.
Check the README for instructions on how to build and run  and the language server, and to see a summary of what’s implemented so far.
We’ll be posting regular updates as new functionality becomes available for testing.Our native implementation is already capable of loading many popular TypeScript projects, including the TypeScript compiler itself.
Here are times to run  on some popular codebases on GitHub of varying sizes:While we’re not yet feature-complete, these numbers are representative of the order of magnitude performance improvement you’ll see checking most codebases.We’re incredibly excited about the opportunities that this massive speed boost creates. Features that once seemed out of reach are now within grasp.
This native port will be able to provide instant, comprehensive error listings across an entire project, support more advanced refactorings, and enable deeper insights that were previously too expensive to compute.
This new foundation goes beyond today’s developer experience and will enable the next generation of AI tools to enhance development, powering new tools that will learn, adapt, and improve the coding experience.Most developer time is spent in editors, and it’s where performance is most important.
We want editors to load large projects quickly, and respond quickly in all situations.
Modern editors like Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code have excellent performance as long as the underlying language services are also fast.
With our native implementation, we’ll be able to provide incredibly fast editor experiences.Again using the Visual Studio Code codebase as a benchmark, the current time to load the entire project in the editor on a fast computer is about 9.6 seconds.
This drops down to about 1.2 seconds with the native language service, an 8x improvement in project load time in editor scenarios.
What this translates to is a faster working experience from the time you open your editor to your first keystroke in any TypeScript codebase.
We expect all projects to see this level of improvement in load time.Overall memory usage also appears to be roughly half of the current implementation, though we haven’t actively investigated optimizing this yet and expect to realize further improvements.
Editor responsiveness for all language service operations (including completion lists, quick info, go to definition, and find all references) will also see significant speed gains.
We’ll also be moving to the Language Server Protocol (LSP), a longstanding infrastructural work item to better align our implementation with other languages.Our most recent TypeScript release was TypeScript 5.8, with TypeScript 5.9 coming soon.
The JS-based codebase will continue development into the 6.x series, and TypeScript 6.0 will introduce some deprecations and breaking changes to align with the upcoming native codebase.When the native codebase has reached sufficient parity with the current TypeScript, we’ll be releasing it as .
This is still in development and we’ll be announcing stability and feature milestones as they occur.For the sake of clarity, we’ll refer to them simply as TypeScript 6 (JS) and TypeScript 7 (native), since this will be the nomenclature for the foreseeable future.
You may also see us refer to “Strada” (the original TypeScript codename) and “Corsa” (the codename for this effort) in internal discussions or code comments.While some projects may be able to switch to TypeScript 7 upon release, others may depend on certain API features, legacy configurations, or other constraints that necessitate using TypeScript 6.
Recognizing TypeScript’s critical role in the JS development ecosystem, we’ll still be maintaining the JS codebase in the 6.x line until TypeScript 7+ reaches sufficient maturity and adoption.Our long-term goal is to keep these versions as closely aligned as possible so that you can upgrade to TypeScript 7 as soon as it meets your requirements, or fall back to TypeScript 6 if necessary.In the coming months we’ll be sharing more about this exciting effort, including deeper looks into performance, a new compiler API, LSP, and more.
We’ve written up some FAQs on the GitHub repo to address some questions we expect you might have.
We also invite you to join us for an AMA at the TypeScript Community Discord at  on March 13th.A 10x performance improvement represents a massive leap in the TypeScript and JavaScript development experience, so we hope you are as enthusiastic as we are for this effort!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google&apos;s Pixel Watch Knows When Your Heart Stops Beating</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/heart-attack-smartwatch</link><author>Elissa Welle</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NjcwNTY3Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3Mjg3MTEyOH0.GzE5L4Fb8ueiISIYEvX3bBMzEfsD14la9xuOopm36Mk/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 14:30:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The feature set to roll out in the U.S. this month will call 911 if you can’t]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Happy 20th birthday, Y Combinator</title><link>https://twitter.com/garrytan/status/1899092996702048709</link><author>btilly</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 14:14:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Graveyard at the Center of the Earth</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=din1J2mZmc4</link><author>PBS Eons</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/din1J2mZmc4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 14:00:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzR-rom72PHN9Zg7RML9EbA">PBS Eons</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It's Patron Appreciation Month at Eons, and you're invited!

It provides a controlled environment where AI models can attempt complex automation, resource management, and optimisation tasks in a grounded world with meaningful constraints.A critical advantage of Factorio as a benchmark is its unbounded nature. Unlike many evals that are quickly saturated by newer models, Factorio's geometric complexity scaling means it won't be "solved" in the next 6 months (or possibly even years). This allows us to meaningfully compare models by the order-of-magnitude of resources they can produce - creating a benchmark with longevity.The project began 18 months ago after years of playing Factorio, recognising its potential as an AI research testbed. A few months ago, our team (myself, Akbir, and Mart) came together to create a benchmark that tests agent capabilities in spatial reasoning and long-term planning.Two technical innovations drove this project forward: First, we discovered that piping Lua into the Factorio console over TCP enables running (almost) arbitrary code without directly modding the game. Second, we developed a first-class Python API that wraps these Lua programs to provide a clean, type-hinted interface for AI agents to interact with Factorio through familiar programming paradigms.Agents interact with FLE through a REPL pattern:
1. They observe the world (seeing the output of their last action)
2. Generate Python code to perform their next action
3. Receive detailed feedback (including exceptions and stdout)We provide two main evaluation settings:
- Lab-play: 24 structured tasks with fixed resources
- Open-play: An unbounded task of building the largest possible factory on a procedurally generated mapWe found that while LLMs show promising short-horizon skills, they struggle with spatial reasoning in constrained environments. They can discover basic automation strategies (like electric-powered drilling) but fail to achieve more complex automation (like electronic circuit manufacturing). Claude Sonnet 3.5 is currently the best model (by a significant margin).You'll need:
- Factorio (version 1.1.110)
- Docker

When you get to a place financially where you can begin to start saving, rather than living paycheck to paycheck, a big question often comes up: ”Should I pay off my debt or invest in the stock market?” There’s no simple answer, but there’s a simple rule of thumb that can help you decide what to do with this money to have the best financial outcome in the long run. 

The first place to look is the interest rate on your debt and see if it’s below 7%, the rate of return you can conservatively expect from investing in an index fund, like the S&P 500. If your debt — like a mortgage or a student loan — falls below 7%, it is usually mathematically more beneficial to invest in the stock market while you pay down the debt by its minimum payments. The logic being: You’ll likely earn more interest by investing than your debt will accrue in that time. 

Higher interest rate debt, like credit card debt, should almost always be eliminated as soon as possible, since you are statistically unlikely to see a rate of return from investing past 7 to 10% annually. And of course, investing always comes with risk. So the most secure bet is always to work toward being debt-free.

These digital documents serve as containers for everything from scientific research to government records, but their rigid formats often trap the data inside, making it difficult for machines to read and analyze."Part of the problem is that PDFs are a creature of a time when print layout was a big influence on publishing software, and PDFs are more of a 'print' product than a digital one," Derek Willis, a lecturer in Data and Computational Journalism at the University of Maryland, wrote in an email to Ars Technica. "The main issue is that many PDFs are simply pictures of information, which means you need Optical Character Recognition software to turn those pictures into data, especially when the original is old or includes handwriting."Computational journalism is a field where traditional reporting techniques merge with data analysis, coding, and algorithmic thinking to uncover stories that might otherwise remain hidden in large datasets, which makes unlocking that data a particular interest for Willis.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The State of the Ethereum Blockchain with Andrew Koller</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/03/11/the-state-of-the-ethereum-blockchain-with-andrew-koller/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=the-state-of-the-ethereum-blockchain-with-andrew-koller</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED4255543830.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 09:00:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that was created by Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood in 2015.

But instead of facing trial in the US, Lee now lives in Dubai, where he’s pitching new crypto products. 

Lee denies any wrongdoing. But crypto industry experts, alleged victims and online “scam hunters” are raising questions about whether regulators in the United Arab Emirates are doing enough to combat crypto fraud as Dubai seeks to position itself as a hub of finance and technology.

On a scorching July day in Dubai, Sam Lee was inside a climate-controlled wine bar, sipping a glass of chilled red, looking untouchable. Near the beginning of the year, US authorities announced that they’d charged Lee with conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud. They alleged that, as the co-founder of a company called HyperVerse, he’d orchestrated a cryptocurrency scam that bilked investors around the world for almost $2 billion. HyperVerse had promised returns as high as 1% a day via cutting-edge blockchain-based strategies, but according to the US Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission, it was just an old-fashioned Ponzi scheme. Lee has denied wrongdoing.

On the other hand, GraphQL, a newer query language developed by Facebook, takes a more flexible and efficient approach, allowing clients to request exactly the data they need in a single request.In this article, we’ll break down REST and GraphQL, compare their differences, and help you decide which one is best suited for your use case.If you’re finding this newsletter valuable and want to deepen your learning, consider becoming a .As a paid subscriber, you'll receive an exclusive deep-dive article every week, access to a structured100+topics and interview questions, and other . emerged in the early 2000s as a set of architectural principles for designing networked applications.REST is not a protocol or standard but rather a set of guiding principles that leverage the existing  to enable communication between clients and servers.At its core, REST is built around . Each resource (such as a user, order, or product) is uniquely identified by a Uniform Resource Locator, and clients interact with these resources using a fixed set of HTTP methods. → Retrieve a resource (e.g.,  to fetch user data). → Create a new resource (e.g.,  to add a new user). → Update an existing resource (e.g.,  to update user details). → Remove a resource (e.g.,  to delete a user).For example, let’s say a client needs information about a specific user with .The client makes a requestThe server responds with a JSON representation of the userREST APIs typically  and use  to communicate the outcome of the request: → Resource successfully created → Client error (e.g., missing required fields) → Requested resource does not exist500 Internal Server Error → Unexpected server issueSimplicity and Intuitive Design: The resource-based model aligns well with most business domains, making REST intuitive for developers.: Each request contains all the information needed to complete it, making REST scalable across distributed systems.: HTTP's caching mechanisms can be leveraged to improve performance.REST APIs can be easily scaled using load balancers and CDNs.: With nearly two decades of widespread use, REST enjoys robust tooling, documentation, and developer familiarity.REST endpoints often return , leading to inefficient network usage. For example, if a mobile app only needs a user’s name and email, but the API response includes additional fields like address, phone number, and metadata, it results in .: If an API doesn’t return related data, the client may need to  to retrieve all required information. For example, to get user details and their posts, a client might have to make: (fetch user) (fetch user’s posts): When APIs evolve, maintaining backward compatibility becomes difficult. REST APIs often require  (, ), adding maintenance overhead.Rigid Response Structure: The server defines how data is returned, and clients must adapt to it—even if they only need a subset of the data.For years,  was the de facto standard for building APIs. However, as applications grew more complex, REST began to show limitations—especially in scenarios where clients needed fine-grained control over the data they fetched.To address these challenges, Facebook introduced GraphQL in 2015, offering a more flexible and efficient approach to data retrieval.Unlike REST, which organizes APIs around fixed endpoints and HTTP methods, GraphQL is a  that allows clients to request exactly the data they need—nothing more, nothing less.A  () replaces multiple REST endpoints, allowing clients to structure their own queries instead of relying on predefined responses.Here, the query asks for a specific user's firstName, email, profileUrl and posts, all within a GraphQL aggregates the data from multiple services and returns precisely the requested data.It solves the problems of  (getting unnecessary data) and  (requiring multiple requests to retrieve related data).Unlike REST, where API responses are  and may vary across versions, GraphQL enforces a strict schema that defines the shape of the data.A simple GraphQL schema for the above example might look like this:type User {
  id: ID!
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
  email: String!
  profile: Profile!
  posts: [Post!]
}

type Profile {
  id: ID!
  url: String!
}

type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  publishedDate: String!
  content: String!
  author: User!
}

type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User
  posts: [Post!]!
}Three Core Functionalities of GraphQLGraphQL provides three core functionalities:Similar to GET requests in REST, GraphQL queries allow clients to request specific fields of data.Clients have full control over what they retrieve, avoiding unnecessary data fetching.Example: Fetching specific user and post details in a single requestquery {
  user(id: 123) {
    name
    email
    posts {
      title
      content
    }
  }
}Equivalent to POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE in REST. Used to create, update, or delete resources in the API.Example: Creating a new postmutation {
  createPost(title: "GraphQL vs REST", content: "GraphQL solves many of REST's limitations...", publishedDate: "2025-03-10") {
    id
    title
    content
  }
}The response will contain the newly created post with its .3.  → Real-Time UpdatesUnlike REST, which requires polling or WebSockets for real-time updates, GraphQL subscriptions enable clients to listen for changes and receive updates automatically when data is modified.Ideal for chat applications, live feeds, stock market updates, and notifications.Example: Listening for new postssubscription {
  newPost {
    title
    content
    author {
      name
    }
  }
}Whenever a , all subscribed clients will .How GraphQL Differs from RESTBoth GraphQL and REST rely on HTTP requests and responses, but they differ in how they structure and deliver data.REST centers around resources (each identified by a URL).GraphQL centers around a schema that defines the types of data available.In REST, the  decides which data is included in a response. If a client requests a blog post, the API might also return related , even if they aren’t needed.With GraphQL, the  what to fetch. This makes GraphQL more flexible but also introduces challenges in caching and performance optimization.: Clients can request only the fields they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching.Single Request for Multiple Resources: Related data can be retrieved in one request, solving REST’s  query problem.: GraphQL APIs use a schema to define available data, making them easier to explore and document.Real-time Data with Subscriptions: GraphQL natively supports real-time data updates through subscriptions, enabling clients to receive automatic notifications whenever data changes on the server.API Evolution Without Versioning: New fields can be added without breaking existing queries, avoiding REST-style ,  versioning issues.: Unlike REST, which can be used with basic HTTP clients (cURL, browsers), GraphQL requires a GraphQL server, schema, and resolvers.: REST APIs leverage HTTP caching (e.g., browser caching, CDNs), but GraphQL queries use POST requests, making caching trickier. Since clients can request arbitrary amounts of data, GraphQL APIs must be carefully optimized to prevent performance issues. Unoptimized queries (e.g., deeply nested requests) can lead to costly database scans, increasing the risk of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.Performance Risks with GraphQLImagine a mobile app introduces a  that unexpectedly triggers a  on a critical database table.With REST, this scenario is less likely because API endpoints are predefined, and developers control how data is exposed.With GraphQL, the client , which could inadvertently request massive amounts of data. If a poorly designed query is executed on a high-traffic service, it could bring down the entire database.To mitigate this, GraphQL APIs require strict query rate limiting, depth restrictions, and cost analysis mechanisms—adding additional complexity to the implementation.There is no  answer.  remains a great choice for simple APIs, while  is powerful for complex applications with varying data needs.Ultimately, it’s not about which is better, but which is better for your specific needs.Your API is simple and doesn’t require flexible queries.You need caching benefits from HTTP. You need a standardized, well-established API  approach.You’re integrating with third-party services.Your team is already familiar with REST and need faster implementation.You need flexible and efficient data fetching.Your API serves multiple clients (mobile, web, IoT) with different data needs.Real-time updates are required (GraphQL subscriptions). You want to avoid API versioning issues.Your application requires deeply nested dataCan You Use Both REST and GraphQL?Absolutely! REST and GraphQL are , and many organizations implement a  to get the best of both worlds:GraphQL for client-facing applications where flexibility, performance, and dynamic querying are essential.REST for admin interfaces, third-party integrations, and internal microservices where statelessness, caching, and simplicity are beneficial.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.This post is public so feel free to share it.

That’s a reality for thousands in Germany, who despite having a job cannot find a place to live. 

Attila Kokas works for the Berlin City Mission as a gardener. Denny Wagner is a cook. At an emergency shelter he prepares food for homeless people. For a few months now, Denny has been spending nights in a small, simple hut with no electricity. Attila sleeps on the street, before he makes his way to work in the early hours. Despite having jobs, both men have been unable to find an affordable apartment in Berlin. They share their fate with quite a few people in Germany. In larger cities in particular, the housing market is tight. This hits people emerging from homelessness and earning low wages especially hard. How can they get away from being without a roof?

The prospect of Washington cutting off support to Kyiv in the face of Russian aggression has prompted European NATO members like Germany, France and the United Kingdom to step up. Europe doesn’t make enough—or in some cases any—of the air-defense systems or long-range rocket artillery that Ukraine relies on like the Patriot and ATACMS.

WSJ breaks down whether European NATO countries have the money, equipment and personnel to fill the gap.

In a demo video Limor 'Ladyada' Fried compares the LLM's command-line interface to working with the build-automation tool CMake or "a weird cross between IRC and a BBS." The first step was converting a PDF of the hardware's datasheet into text, and Claude Code first displays the appropriate Bash command, while asking "Do you want to proceed?" ("What's nice is that it doesn't make changes, even though it has write access to files in the directory...") Eventually from the data sheet it creates things like an accurate register map, C++ headers, and even license text — and more. 

"We are using it to automate parts of the coding and debugging process for an Arduino-compatible Metro Mini board with an OPT 4048 color sensor," writes ptorrone:
Using Claude Code's shell access, we can compile, upload, and test code in a semi-automated workflow, allowing the LLM to suggest fixes for errors along the way... While the AI isn't perfect for high-level driver development, it's proving VERY useful for tedious debugging and super-fast iterative improvements, bringing hardware automation closer to ...reality. 
In the video Fried describes it like this. "I have a full debugging cycle, where I'm there — I'm like driving the car — but I have this copilot that's telling me where to go..." 

"I feel like I'm getting closer to having a semi-automated way of doing driver development."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Sphinx</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/the-sphinx</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/67c99971fc5f88b98d88db92/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=Ny2jz0WJhZWoGFy6wT3sHklkR2Hs2Bbxor5HoXtuSx4" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Great Sphinx of Giza is probably the most recognisable statue in the world but it’s also one of the most mysterious...with conflicting stories about who built it and why have circulated since ancient times.

European markets rallied sharply this week as German borrowing costs soared after the country’s new leaders announced a historic deal to loosen its “debt brake” rule to boost spending on defense.

The interest rate on German government bonds saw their biggest daily increase since October 1998.

The Dax 30 index, which tracks the largest German companies, rose by 3.5% as stock prices also leapt in other European markets amid hopes that a massive boost in European spending on defense and infrastructure would kickstart the region’s lagging economy.

But the Trump administration has cut off vital support for their jamming capabilities, which could deprive the Ukrainian Air Force of a critical air countermeasure.However, as Forbes analyst David Ax writes , the Ukrainians are not powerless and can shift the burden of air jamming onto the French Dassault Mirage 2000 fighters.As Aks points out, the Ukrainian Air Force is taking full advantage of the ability of F-16s equipped with AN/ALQ-131 pods to flood Russian radar screens with electronic noise. They act as “flying air defenses” with advanced missile warning technology, notes the Conflict Intelligence Team.But the Russian Air Force can circumvent the jamming by reprogramming its radars to different frequencies. As Axe points out, while the Biden Air Force was able to keep up with the Russian adaptation by constantly tweaking the AN/ALQ-131 frequencies, under Trump, Ukrainian pilots are not receiving updates, and the programs could soon become obsolete.However, France’s Mirage 2000s are equipped with their own powerful jammers, and the Americans are not involved in their programming, the analyst notes.The Mirage 2000-5F currently in service with the French Air Force flies with a combination of the Serval radar warning receiver, Sabre jammer and Eclair flare dispenser. This system was cutting edge in the 1980s, but within a generation it was falling behind.“Recognizing this weakness and understanding the seriousness of the Russian missile threat over Ukraine, the French Ministry of Defense promised to install new electronic countermeasures on the Mirage 2000s before handing them over to Ukraine. The ministry probably had in mind the predominantly analog Integrated Countermeasures Suite Mark 2 or the all-digital Integrated Countermeasures Suite Mark 3,” Ax notes.Either system is an improvement over the older system and a potential replacement for the AN/ALQ-131, as the American pods lag behind the Russian adaptation. The French are firm allies of Ukraine and are willing to reprogram the jammers if necessary.In the longer term, the Ukrainians could refit their F-16s with non-American electronic countermeasures, Axe notes. But that could take time and money that Ukraine cannot afford.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>My 16-month theanine self-experiment</title><link>https://dynomight.net/theanine/</link><author>dynm</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Mar 2025 03:08:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The internet theanine. This is an amino acid analog that’s naturally found in tea, but now sold as a nutritional supplement for anxiety or mood or memory.Biologically speaking, it’s plausible. Theanine is structurally related to the neurotransmitter glutamate (theanine = C₇H₁₄N₂O₃, glutamate = C₅H₈NO₄-). For some reason, everyone is obsessed with stupid flashy dopamine and serotonin, and no one cares about glutamate. But it’s the most common neurotransmitter and theanine is both metabolized into glutamate and seems to itself have various complicated effects on glutamate receptors.Of course, there are lots of supplements that  act on the brain, but are useless when taken orally. That’s because your brain is isolated from your circulatory system by a thin layer of cells that are extremely picky about what they let through. But it appears that theanine  get through these cells and into the brain.So that sounds good. But do these low-level effects actually lead to changes in mood in real humans? When I looked into the academic research, I was surprised by how weak it was. Personally, on these kinds of issues, I find the European Food Safety Authority to be the single most trustworthy scientific body. They did an assessment in 2011 and found:Improvement of cognitive functioncause and effect relationship has not been establishedAlleviation of psychological stresscause and effect relationship has not been establishedMaintenance of normal sleepcause and effect relationship has not been establishedReduction of menstrual discomfortcause and effect relationship has not been establishedExamine is an independent website that’s respected for summarizing the scientific literature on health and supplements. They looked into if theanine helped with various things, like alertness, anxiety, and attention. In all cases found  for .A 2020 review of eight randomized double-blind placebo controlled trials found that theanine  help with stress and anxiety. While this review seems generally good, I found it to be insufficiently paranoid. One study they review found that theanine worked better than alprazolam (xanax) for acute anxiety. The correct response would be, “That’s , and the fact that normal scientific practices could lead to such a conclusion casts doubt on everything.” But the review sort of takes it at value and moves on.After 2020, the only major trial I could find was this 2021 study that took 52 healthy older Japanese people and gave them theanine (or placebo) for 12 weeks. They tested for improvements in a million different measures of cognitive functioning and mostly found nothing.I’ve long found that tea makes me much less nervous than coffee, even with equal caffeine. Many people have suggested theanine as the explanation, but I’m skeptical. Most tea only has ~5 mg of theanine per cup, while when people supplement, they take 100-400 mg. Apparently grassy shade-grown Japanese teas are particularly high in theanine. And I  find those teas particularly calming. But they still only manage ~25 mg per cup. (Maybe it’s because tea is better than coffee?)Still, I’ve supplemented theanine on and off for more than 10 years, and it seems helpful. So after seeing the weak scientific evidence, I thought: Why not do a self-experiment?Theanine seems ideal because it’s a supplement with short term effects. So you can test it against placebo. (Try that with meditation.) And you can build up a large sample using a single human body without waiting weeks for it to build up in the body before each measurement.Everyone agrees theanine is safe. It’s biologically plausible. While academic studies haven’t proven a benefit, they haven’t  one either. Given the vast  evidence, I saw a chance to stick it to the stodgy scientific establishment, to show the power of internet people and give the first rigorous evidence that theanine really works. Stockholm, prepare thyself.First, I needed placebos. This was super annoying. The obvious way to create them would be to buy some empty capsules and fill some with theanine and others with some inert substance. But that doesn’t sound fun. Isn’t the whole idea of modernity that we’re supposed to replace labor with capital?So I went searching for a pair of capsules I could buy off the shelf, subject to the following constraints:Capsule A contains 200 mg of theanine.Capsule B contains something with minimal acute effects on anxiety, stress, memory, concentration, etc.Capsule B contains something I don’t mind putting into my body.Both capsules are exactly the same size and weight.Both capsules are almost but not  the same color.Both capsules are made by some company with a history of making at least a modest effort to sell supplements that contain what they say they contain, and that don’t have terrifying levels of heavy metals.After a ludicrous amount of searching, I found that NOW® sells these veggie capsules: 200 mg L-Theanine 25 mcg (1,000 IU) Vitamin DThese are exactly the same size, exactly the same weight, exactly the same texture, and  close in color. They’re so close in color that under warm lighting, they’re indistinguishable. But under cold/blue lighting, the vitamin D capsules are  more yellow. Vitamin D might have some effects on mood, but no one seems to claim that they’re , that you’d feel them within an hour.For dosing, I decided to take a capsule whenever I was feeling stressed or anxious. Some people worry this invalidates the results. Not so! I’m still choosing randomly, and this better reflects how people use theanine in practice.Theanine is often recommended for reducing anxiety from caffeine. While I didn’t explicitly take caffeine as part of this experiment, I had almost always taken some anyway.Statistically, it would have been best to randomize so I had a 50% chance of taking theanine and a 50% chance of taking vitamin D. But I decided that would be annoying, since I was taking these capsules when stressed. So I decided to randomize so I got theanine ⅔ of the time and vitamin D ⅓ of the time.Randomization was very easy: I took two theanine capsules and one vitamin D capsule and put them into a little cup. I then closed my eyes, shook the cup around a bit and took one. I then covered the cup with a card.This picture shows one vitamin D capsule (top) and two theanine capsules.For each trial, I recorded my subjective starting stress level on a scale of 1-5, then set an alarm for an hour, which is enough to reach near-peak concentrations in the blood. After the alarm sounded (or occasionally later, if I missed it) I recorded the end time, my end stress level, and my percentage prediction that what I’d taken was actually theanine. Then, and only then, I looked into the cup. If the two remaining pills were different colors, I’d taken theanine. If not, it was vitamin D.After ~14 months, I got frustrated by how slowly data was coming in. This was the first time in my life I’ve had  much chill. At that point, I decided to start taking the capsules once or twice a day, even if I wasn’t stressed. I’ll show the transition point in the graphs below.Ultimately, I collected 94 data points, which look like this:Here are the raw stress levels. Each line line shows one trial, with the start marked with a tiny horizontal bar. Note the clear change when I started dosing daily:Alternatively, here’s the  in stress (end - start) as a function of time. If “Δ Stress” is negative, that means stress went down.Here are the start and end stress levels for each trial, ignoring time. The dotted line shows equal stress levels, so anything below that line means stress went down:Finally, here are the probabilities I gave that each capsule was in fact theanine.My stress level  usually go down, at least provided I was stressed at the start. But it went down regardless of if I took theanine or not. And I was  at guessing what I’d taken.Why did my stress decrease when I took vitamin D? Maybe it’s the placebo effect. But I suspect it’s mostly reversion to the mean: If you mark down the times in your life when you’re most stressed, on average you’ll be less stressed an hour later. You can see some evidence for this in that stress tended to decrease more when it started at a higher level.So, eyeballing the above figures, theanine doesn’t appear to do anything. (We can argue about statistics below.) Why? I think these are the possibilities:Theanine works, but I got fake theanine.Theanine works, but vitamin D works equally well.Theanine works, but I was unlucky.Theanine works, but I’m disembodied and unable to report my internal states.Theanine works on some people, but not me.It’s hard to disprove the idea that theanine works. But I tell you this: I expected it to work. And I  tried. For almost 100 trials over 16 months, I paid attention to what I was feeling and tried to detect  sign that I’d taken theanine, even if it wasn’t a change in stress. I could detect nothing. Even after months of failure, I’d often feel confident that  time I could tell, only to be proven wrong.Should I have been surprised by these results? Well, the scientific literature on theanine hasn’t found much of an effect. And the only other  self-experiment on theanine I’ve found is by Niplav, who found it did slightly worse than chance and declared it a “hard pass”.What about other blinded self-experiments with other substances? They’re surprisingly scarce, but here’s what I could find:Stimulants work! But for everything else…I particularly encourage you to read the sleep support post. He was confident it worked, he’d recommended it to lots of friends, but it totally failed when put to the test.I’ve seen  other self-experiments (including for theanine), but they’re non-blinded and I’d be doing you a disservice if I linked to them. People often mention that  this means the results aren’t scientific, but treat it like a small niggling technicality. It’s not.So I propose a new rule: Blind trial or GTFO.I know many people reading this probably use and like theanine. Maybe it works for you! But given the weak academic results, and given the fact that I actually did a blinded experiment, I think you now have the burden of proof. Doing this kind of test isn’t hard. If you’re sure theanine (or anything else) works, prove it.Appendix: OK fine let’s argue about statisticsDo you demand p-values? Are you outraged I just plotted the data and then started talking about it qualitatively?I think faith in statistics follows a U-shaped curve. By default, people don’t trust them. If you learn a  statistics, they seem great. (Particularly if you’re part of a community that’s formed a little cult around one set of statistical practices and convinced each other that they’re more reliable than they are.) But if you learn a  of statistics, then you realize all the assumptions that are needed and all the ways things can go wrong and you become very paranoid.If you want p-values, I’ll give you p-values. But first let me point out a problem.While I was blinded during each trial, I saw the theanine/D result when I wrote it down. Over time I couldn’t help but notice that my stress dropped even when I took vitamin D, and that I was terrible at predicting what I’d taken. So while this experiment is randomized and blinded, the data isn’t  or . If I did this again, I’d make sure I couldn’t see any outcomes until the end, perhaps by making 100 numbered envelopes, putting three capsules in each, and only looking at what was left at the end.But if you want to compute p-values anyway, OK! Here are the basic numbers for the trials when I took theanine:Stress went down, p < .0000001. But here are the the numbers for vitamin D:Technically, I did find two significant results. But the second row says that end stress was slightly  with theanine than with vitamin D, and the last row says that I gave slightly  probabilities that I’d taken theanine when I’d actually taken vitamin D.Of course, I don’t think this means I’ve proven theanine is harmful. I just think this confirms my general paranoia. To a first approximation, if it ain’t visible in the raw data, I ain’t going.Speaking of raw data, you can download mine here.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Happiest man alive</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5Qrt87Ab8U</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/i5Qrt87Ab8U?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 9 Mar 2025 00:52:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Axiom Space and Red Hat Will Bring Edge Computing to the International Space Station</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/03/08/205225/axiom-space-and-red-hat-will-bring-edge-computing-to-the-international-space-station?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 22:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Axiom Space and Red Hat will collaborate to launch Data Center Unit-1 (AxDCU-1) to the International Space Station this spring. It's a small data processing prototype (powered by lightweight, edge-optimized Red Hat Device Edge) that will demonstrate initial Orbital Data Center (ODC) capabilities. 

"It all sounds rather grand for something that resembles a glorified shoebox," reports the Register.
 Axiom Space said: "The prototype will test applications in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning (AI/ML), data fusion and space cybersecurity." 

Space is an ideal environment for edge devices. Connectivity to datacenters on Earth is severely constrained, so the more processing that can be done before data is transmitted to a terrestrial receiving station, the better. Tony James, chief architect, Science and Space at Red Hat, said: "Off-planet data processing is the next frontier, and edge computing is a crucial component. With Red Hat Device Edge and in collaboration with Axiom Space, Earth-based mission partners will have the capabilities necessary to make real-time decisions in space with greater reliability and consistency...." 

The Red Hat Device Edge software used by Axiom's device combines Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the Red Hat Ansible Platform, and MicroShift, a lightweight Kubernetes container orchestration service derived from Red Hat OpenShift. The plan is for Axiom Space to host hybrid cloud applications and cloud-native workloads on-orbit. Jason Aspiotis, global director of in-space data and security, Axiom Space, told The Register that the hardware itself is a commercial off-the-shelf unit designed for operation in harsh environments... "AxDCU-1 will have the ability to be controlled and utilized either via ground-to-space or space-to-space communications links. Our current plans are to maintain this device on the ISS. We plan to utilize this asset for at least two years." 
The article notes that HPE has also "sent up a succession of Spaceborne computers — commercial, off-the-shelf supercomputers — over the years to test storage, recovery, and operational potential on long-duration missions." (They apparently use Red Hat Enterprise Linux.) "At the other end of the scale, the European Space Agency has run Raspberry Pi computers on the ISS for years as part of the AstroPi educational outreach program." 

Axiom Space says their Orbital Data Center is deigned to "reduce delays traditionally associated with orbital data processing and analysis."

By utilizing Earth-independent cloud storage and edge processing infrastructure, Axiom Space ODCs will enable data to be processed closer to its source, spacecraft or satellites, bypassing the need for terrestrial-based data centers. This architecture alleviates reliance on costly, slow, intermittent or contested network connections, creating more secure and quicker decision-making in space. 
The goal is to allow Axiom Space and its partners to have access to real-time processing capabilities, laying the foundation for increased reliability and improved space cybersecurity with extensive applications. Use cases for ODCs include but are not limited to supporting Earth observation satellites with in-space and lower latency data storage and processing, AI/ML training on-orbit, multi-factor authentication and cyber intrusion detection and response, supervised autonomy, in-situ space weather analytics and off-planet backup & disaster recovery for critical infrastructure on Earth.

We are being boiled like frogs. It happened gradually, one algorithmic tweak at a time. What started as a way to connect with friends has become a system that gives the corporations that run social media control over what we consume and the ability to subtly shape how we think.
We used to control apps like Facebook and Instagram with our own choices. They became daily comforts, making the world seem a little bit smaller and closer by bringing the people that we cared about together in to one place.But from the perspective of these companies, that’s a problem. Our personal worlds, our friends, family, and connections, are finite. Once we’ve caught up, we put the app down. That’s bad for business.Social media companies need us flicking through their apps as long as they can keep us there. More eyes on ads is more money. So they play the system a bit. You’ve lingered on enough photos of cute puppies, they know what you like.Before long those feeds of finite content are replaced by infinite algorithmic content pulled from millions of users trying to optimise their posts to be picked up by the omnipotent algorithms. Algorithms which are completely opaque to us.Sci-fi imagines megacorporations controlling our minds with brain implants. Some worry that companies are already listening in. But they don’t have to - they already control our eyes.The creators of TikTok, Instagram etc. have gained control over exactly what we see. What we see strongly influences how we think. They know that their feeds make us angry, they know the negative effects on our mental health (particularly that of teens), and they know that they have an influence on our opinion.With the power to shape what we see comes the power to shape what we believe. Whether through deliberate manipulation or the slow creep of algorithmic recommendations, engagement is fueled by outrage, and outrage breeds extremism. The result is a feedback loop that isolates users, reinforces beliefs, and deprioritises opposing viewpoints.We live in times where being able to form our own opinion is more important than ever. Where knowing how to source and identify truthful information is a critical skill.Our reliance on being spoon fed ideas is destroying those abilities, Alec of Technology Connections calls this algorithmic complacency, referencing our increasing inability to look outside our algorithmically created bubble. The social media companies don’t care, the only person who has any interest in fixing this is you.It’s time to take back control of how we think. We’ve identified the problem, now it’s time to take action.We don’t all have the freedom, interest or willpower to delete social media from our lives entirely. It’s still where our friends are, an occasional distraction from reality and a source of entertainment. You don’t have to become a digital outcast to hold back this influence.Go directly to the source - if you like a particular TikTok creator, Facebook page or YouTube channel, skip the feed and go directly to their pages. Consider bookmarking their profiles individually.Learn to find information and entertainment without a feed - try to find a creator making videos or writing about a topic of interest without having to stumble across them in a feed.Use platforms and platform features that let you control your experience - Instagram’s ‘Following’ feed, YouTube’s Subscriptions page, Bluesky, Mastodon and RSS feedsBe mindful of engagement traps - recognise how algorithmic feeds are designed to keep you engaged and scrolling. Take a breath and stop the cycle.Talk about it - if you’re reading this you a already know this is a problem. Your friends and family may not be aware of how their feeds are manipulating their attention and beliefs. Without intervention, the radicalisation of opinions, and the consequences we’re already seeing, will only escalate.The internet should serve you, not the other way around. Take back control. Kill your feeds before they kill your ability to think independently.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Digital Airport Towers Could Replace Traditional ATC Towers</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pXIyrJv0Bg</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/1pXIyrJv0Bg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 15:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Despite huge leaps forward in aviation technology and safety, air-traffic controllers still depend on radar and sight.

It's initially available on Pixel devices running Android 15 but will be expanded to "all sufficiently robust Android phones" when Android 16 arrives later this year," writes ZDNet's Steven Vaughan-Nichols. An anonymous reader shares an excerpt from the report: Today, Linux is only available on the latest Pixel devices running Android 15. When Android 16 arrives later this year, it's expected that all sufficiently robust Android phones will be able to run Linux. Besides a Linux terminal, beta tests have already shown that you should be able to run desktop Linux programs from your phone -- games like Doom, for example. The Linux Terminal runs on top of a Debian Linux virtual machine. This enables you to access a shell interface directly on your Android device. And that just scratches the surface of Google's Linux Terminal. It's actually a do-it-all app that enables you to download, configure, and run Debian. Underneath Terminal runs the Android Virtualization Framework (AVF). These are the APIs that enable Android devices to run other operating systems.
 
To try the Linux Terminal app, you must activate Developer Mode by navigating to Settings - About Phone and tapping the build number seven times. I guess Google wants to make sure you want to do this. Once Developer Mode is enabled, the app can be activated via Settings - System - Developer options - Linux development environment. The initial setup may take a while because it needs to download Debian. Typically this is a 500MB download. Once in place, it allows you to adjust disk space allocation, set port controls for network communication, and recover the virtual machine's storage partition. However, it currently lacks support for graphical user interface (GUI) applications. For that, we'll need to wait for Android 16.
 
According to Android specialist Mishaal Rahman, 'Google wants to turn Android into a proper desktop operating system, and in order to do that, it has to make it work better with traditional PC input methods and display options. Therefore, Google is now testing new external display management tools in Android 16 that bring Android closer to other desktop OSes.']]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What does “PhD-level” AI mean?

According to a report from The Information, OpenAI may be planning to launch several specialized AI "agent" products, including a $20,000 monthly tier focused on supporting "PhD-level research." Other reportedly planned agents include a "high-income knowledge worker" assistant at $2,000 monthly and a software developer agent at $10,000 monthly.OpenAI has not yet confirmed these prices, but they have mentioned PhD-level AI capabilities before. So what exactly constitutes "PhD-level AI"? The term refers to models that supposedly perform tasks requiring doctoral-level expertise. These include agents conducting advanced research, writing and debugging complex code without human intervention, and analyzing large datasets to generate comprehensive reports. The key claim is that these models can tackle problems that typically require years of specialized academic training.Companies like OpenAI base their "PhD-level" claims on performance in specific benchmark tests. For example, OpenAI's o1 series models reportedly performed well in science, coding, and math tests, with results similar to human PhD students on challenging tasks. The company's Deep Research tool, which can generate research papers with citations, scored 26.6 percent on "Humanity's Last Exam," a comprehensive evaluation covering over 3,000 questions across more than 100 subjects.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Rise and Fall of Terrorgram (trailer) | FRONTLINE</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xydLuigooY</link><author>FRONTLINE PBS | Official</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/_xydLuigooY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 7 Mar 2025 22:23:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ScyryU9Oy9Wse3a8OAmYQ">FRONTLINE PBS | Official</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[FRONTLINE and ProPublica investigate how an online network known as Terrorgram spread extremism and violence.

Today I want to talk about ANSI escape codes.For a long time I was vaguely aware of ANSI escape codes (“that’s how you make
text red in the terminal and stuff”) but I had no real understanding of where they were
supposed to be defined or whether or not there were standards for them. I just
had a kind of vague “there be dragons” feeling around them. While learning
about the terminal this year, I’ve learned that:ANSI escape codes are responsible for a lot of usability improvements
in the terminal (did you know there’s a way to copy to your system clipboard
when SSHed into a remote machine?? It’s an escape code called OSC 52!)They aren’t completely standardized, and because of that they don’t always
work reliably. And because they’re also invisible, it’s extremely
frustrating to troubleshoot escape code issues.So I wanted to put together a list for myself of some standards that exist
around escape codes, because I want to know if they  to feel unreliable
and frustrating, or if there’s a future where we could all rely on them with
more confidence.Have you ever pressed the left arrow key in your terminal and seen ?
That’s an escape code! It’s called an “escape code” because the first character
is the “escape” character, which is usually written as , , ,
, or .Escape codes are how your terminal emulator communicates various kinds of
information (colours, mouse movement, etc) with programs running in the
terminal. There are two kind of escape codes: which your terminal emulator sends for keypresses or mouse
movements that don’t fit into Unicode. For example “left arrow key” is
, “Ctrl+left arrow” might be , and clicking the mouse might
be something like . which programs can print out to colour text, move the
cursor around, clear the screen, hide the cursor, copy text to the
clipboard, enable mouse reporting, set the window title, etc.Now let’s talk about standards!The first standard I found relating to escape codes was
ECMA-48,
which was originally published in 1976.Define some general  for escape codes (like “CSI” codes, which are
 + something and “OSC” codes, which are  + something)Define some specific escape codes, like how “move the cursor to the left” is
, or “turn text red” is  . In the spec, the “cursor left”
one is called  and the one for changing colours is called
.The formats are extensible, so there’s room for others to define more escape
codes in the future. Lots of escape codes that are popular today aren’t defined
in ECMA-48: for example it’s pretty common for terminal applications (like vim,
htop, or tmux) to support using the mouse, but ECMA-48 doesn’t define escape
codes for the mouse.There are a bunch of escape codes that aren’t defined in ECMA-48, for example:enabling mouse reporting (where did you click in your terminal?)bracketed paste (did you paste that text or type it in?)OSC 52 (which terminal applications can use to copy text to your system clipboard)I believe (correct me if I’m wrong!) that these and some others came from
xterm, are documented in XTerm Control Sequences, and have
been widely implemented by other terminal emulators.This list of “what xterm supports” is not a standard exactly, but xterm is
extremely influential and so it seems like an important document.In the 80s (and to some extent today, but my understanding is that it was MUCH
more dramatic in the 80s) there was a huge amount of variation in what escape
codes terminals actually supported.To deal with this, there’s a database of escape codes for various terminals
called “terminfo”.It looks like the standard for terminfo is called X/Open Curses, though you need to create
an account to view that standard for some reason. It defines the database format as well
as a C library interface (“curses”) for accessing the database.For example you can run this bash snippet to see every possible escape code for
“clear screen” for all of the different terminals your system knows about:for term in $(toe -a | awk '{print $1}')
do
  echo $term
  infocmp -1 -T "$term" 2>/dev/null | grep 'clear=' | sed 's/clear=//g;s/,//g'
done
On my system (and probably every system I’ve ever used?), the terminfo database is managed by ncurses.should programs use terminfo?I think it’s interesting that there are two main approaches that applications
take to handling ANSI escape codes:Use the terminfo database to figure out which escape codes to use, depending
on what’s in the  environment variable. Fish does this, for example.Identify a “single common set” of escape codes which works in “enough”
terminal emulators and just hardcode those.Some examples of programs/libraries that take approach #2 (“don’t use terminfo”) include:[the terminfo authors] have done a lot of work that, at the time, was
extremely important and helpful. My point is that it no longer is.I’m not going to do it justice so I’m not going to summarize it, I think it’s
worth reading.I was just talking about the idea that you can use a “common set” of escape
codes that will work for most people. But what is that set? Is there any agreement?I really do not know the answer to this at all, but from doing some reading it
seems like it’s some combination of:The codes that the VT100 supported (though some aren’t relevant on modern terminals)what’s in ECMA-48 (which I think also has some things that are no longer relevant)What xterm supports (though I’d guess that not everything in there is actually widely supported enough)and maybe ultimately “identify the terminal emulators you think your users are
going to use most frequently and test in those”, the same way web developers do
when deciding which CSS features are okay to useI don’t think there are any resources like Can I use…? or
Baseline for the terminal
though. (in theory terminfo is supposed to be the “caniuse” for the terminal
but it seems like it often takes 10+ years to add new terminal features when
people invent them which makes it very limited)some reasons to use terminfoI also asked on Mastodon why people found terminfo valuable in 2025 and got a
few reasons that made sense to me:some people expect to be able to use the  environment variable to
control how programs behave (for example with ), and there’s
no standard for how that should work in a post-terminfo worldeven though there’s  variation between terminal emulators than
there was in the 80s, there’s far from zero variation: there are graphical
terminals, the Linux framebuffer console, the situation you’re in when
connecting to a server via its serial console, Emacs shell mode, and probably
more that I’m missingthere is no one standard for what the “single common set” of escape codes
is, and sometimes programs use escape codes which aren’t actually widely
supported enoughterminfo & user agent detectionThe way that ncurses uses the  environment variable to decide which
escape codes to use reminds me of how webservers used to sometimes use the
browser user agent to decide which version of a website to serve.It also seems like it’s had some of the same results – the way iTerm2 reports
itself as being “xterm-256color” feels similar to how Safari’s user agent is
“Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 14_7_4) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML,
like Gecko) Version/18.3 Safari/605.1.15”. In both cases the terminal emulator
/ browser ends up changing its user agent to get around user agent detection
that isn’t working well.On the web we ended up deciding that user agent detection was not a good
practice and to instead focus on standardization so we can serve the same
HTML/CSS to all browsers. I don’t know if the same approach is the future in
the terminal though – I think the terminal landscape today is much more
fragmented than the web ever was as well as being much less well funded.some more documents/standardsA few more documents and standards related to escape codes, in no particular order:why I think this is interestingI sometimes see people saying that the unix terminal is “outdated”, and since I
love the terminal so much I’m always curious about what incremental changes
might make it feel less “outdated”.Maybe if we had a clearer standards landscape (like we do on the web!) it would
be easier for terminal emulator developers to build new features and for
authors of terminal applications to more confidently adopt those features so
that we can all benefit from them and have a richer experience in the terminal.Obviously standardizing ANSI escape codes is not easy (ECMA-48 was first
published almost 50 years ago and we’re still not there!). I don’t even know
what all of the challenges are. But the situation with HTML/CSS/JS used to be
extremely bad too and now it’s MUCH better, so maybe there’s hope.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CMU research shows compression alone may unlock AI puzzle-solving abilities</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/compression-conjures-apparent-intelligence-in-new-puzzle-solving-ai-approach/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/compression_illustration_2-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 6 Mar 2025 23:22:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A pair of Carnegie Mellon University researchers recently discovered hints that the process of compressing information can solve complex reasoning tasks without pre-training on a large number of examples.

Their work suggests the answer might be yes. To demonstrate, they created CompressARC and published the results in a comprehensive post on Liao's website.The pair tested their approach on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI), an unbeaten visual benchmark created in 2019 by machine-learning researcher François Chollet to test AI systems' abstract reasoning skills.

22-year-old Billie Carlton’s death caused shockwaves across the nation, adding fuel to a growing moral panic about sex, scandal and drugs.

Hosts of After Dark, Anthony and Maddy are joined by Virginia Berridge, Professor of History and Health Policy at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, to explore the path to drug criminalisation in postwar London following the death of Billie Carlton. Together, they uncover the extraordinary history of drugs in Soho - London’s most notorious neighbourhood in the 1920s.

Historic Soho has been brought to life in the new BBC show Dope Girls, which tells the story of Soho when female gangs ran the nightclubs after the First World War. You can watch now on @BBCiplayer in the UK, @stanaustralia in Australia and on @ctv in Canada.

From hieroglyphs to papyri, the printing press to digitization, each leap has made human knowledge more accessible and actionable, fueling further innovation. Today, we’re at the precipice of the next big leap—to unlock the collective intelligence of all digitized information. Approximately 90% of the world’s organizational data is stored as documents, and to harness this potential, we are introducing Mistral OCR. Mistral OCR is an Optical Character Recognition API that sets a new standard in document understanding. Unlike other models, Mistral OCR comprehends each element of documents—media, text, tables, equations—with unprecedented accuracy and cognition. It takes images and PDFs as input and extracts content in an ordered interleaved text and images.As a result, Mistral OCR is an ideal model to use in combination with a RAG system taking multimodal documents (such as slides or complex PDFs) as input.We have made Mistral OCR as the default model for document understanding across millions of users on Le Chat, and are releasing the API  at 1000 pages / $ (and approximately double the pages per dollar with batch inference). The API is available today on our developer suite la Plateforme, and coming soon to our cloud and inference partners, as well as on-premises.State of the art understanding of complex documentsNatively multilingual and multimodalDoc-as-prompt, structured outputSelectively available to self-host for organizations dealing with highly sensitive or classified informationState of the art understanding of complex documentsMistral OCR excels in understanding complex document elements, including interleaved imagery, mathematical expressions, tables, and advanced layouts such as LaTeX formatting. The model enables deeper understanding of rich documents such as scientific papers with charts, graphs, equations and figures. Below is an example of the model extracting text as well as imagery from a given PDF into a markdown file. You can access the notebook here. Below we have side-by-side comparisons of PDFs and their respective OCR's outputs. Hover the slider  to switch between input and output. Mistral OCR has consistently outperformed other leading OCR models in rigorous benchmark tests. Its superior accuracy across multiple aspects of document analysis is illustrated below. We extract embedded images from documents along with text. The other LLMs compared below, do not have that capability. For a fair comparison, we evaluate them on our internal “text-only” test-set containing various publication papers, and PDFs from the web; below:Since Mistral’s founding, we have aspired to serve the world with our models, and consequently strived for multilingual capabilities across our offerings. Mistral OCR takes this to a new level, being able to parse, understand, and transcribe thousands of scripts, fonts, and languages across all continents. This versatility is crucial for both global organizations that handle documents from diverse linguistic backgrounds, as well as hyperlocal businesses serving niche markets.Fuzzy Match in GenerationBeing lighter weight than most models in the category, Mistral OCR performs significantly faster than its peers, processing up to 2000 pages per minute on a single node. The ability to rapidly process documents ensures continuous learning and improvement even for high-throughput environments.Doc-as-prompt, structured outputMistral OCR also introduces the use of documents as prompts, enabling more powerful and precise instructions. This capability allows users to extract specific information from documents and format it in structured outputs, such as JSON. Users can chain extracted outputs into downstream function calls and build agents. See this example notebook. Available to self-host on a selective basisFor organizations with stringent data privacy requirements, Mistral OCR offers a self-hosting option. This ensures that sensitive or classified information remains secure within your own infrastructure, providing compliance with regulatory and security standards. If you would like to explore self-deployment with us, please let us know.We are empowering our beta customers to elevate their organizational knowledge by transforming their extensive document repositories into actions and solutions. Some of the key use cases where our technology is making a significant impact include:Digitizing scientific research: Leading research institutions have been experimenting with Mistral OCR to convert scientific papers and journals into AI-ready formats, making them accessible to downstream intelligence engines. This has facilitated measurably faster collaboration and accelerated scientific workflows.Preserving historical and cultural heritage: Organizations and nonprofits that are custodians of heritage have been using Mistral OCR to digitize historical documents and artifacts, ensuring their preservation and making them accessible to a broader audience.Streamlining customer service: Customer service departments are exploring Mistral OCR to transform documentation and manuals into indexed knowledge, reducing response times and improving customer satisfaction.Making literature across design, education, legal, etc. AI ready: Mistral OCR has also been helping companies convert technical literature, engineering drawings, lecture notes, presentations, regulatory filings and much more into indexed, answer-ready formats, unlocking intelligence and productivity across millions of documents.Mistral OCR capabilities are free to try on le Chat. To try the API, head over to la Plateforme. We’d love to get your feedback; expect the model to continue to get even better in the weeks to come. As part of our strategic engagement programs, we will also offer on-premises deployment on a selective basis.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>TikTok just released its React Native killer…</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qjE8JkIVoQ</link><author>Fireship</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/-qjE8JkIVoQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 6 Mar 2025 17:24:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA">Dev - Fireship</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Sign up for CodeRabbit using code FIRESHIP to get get 1-month free https://bit.ly/41rLUxm

--

Two species of Demodex mites specifically inhabit human follicles. And not just some people’s— nearly everyone is thought to host mites. One person’s face might harbor hundreds or even thousands of individual mites. On any given day, these microscopic arachnids are probably eating, mating, and laying eggs inside your pores. So, is this… okay? M. Alejandra Perotti investigates.

That’s not new.

Support our work. Become a Vox Member today: http://www.vox.com/memberships

On the first day of Donald Trump’s second presidential term, he signed an executive order about an old American rule: that with very few exceptions, anyone born here is a citizen. Trump’s order stated that the rule, which comes from the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, should no longer apply to the children of those in the United States illegally or temporarily. Within a few weeks that order had been blocked by multiple federal judges — but it was a temporary resolution, with the ultimate outcome yet to be determined, probably by the Supreme Court.

The US is far from the only country in the world that offers unconditional birthright citizenship. While it’s uncommon in Europe, Asia, and Africa, it’s very common among Western Hemisphere countries, partly because of their history as colonies populated mostly by settlers. But of the many countries with birthright citizenship in the world, the US is by far the largest, with hundreds of thousands of baby citizens born here every year to noncitizen parents. Those numbers naturally raise the question: Is this what birthright citizenship was meant for? And why do we have birthright citizenship in the first place?

The short answer is that birthright citizenship in the US came about as a way of granting citizenship after the American Civil War to the large population of formerly enslaved Black people. But that raises a different question: How did a law intended for Black Americans end up creating hundreds of thousands of new US citizens born to immigrant parents every year? In this video we trace that history, answer that question, and look at a few of the times that the US has actually had this argument before. Today’s concerns over birthright citizenship may feel specific to our particular immigration debate. They’re actually not.

      Michael Knyszek
      6 March 2025
      In last year’s blog post about the  package, we alluded
to some new features then in proposal review, and we’re excited to share that as
of Go 1.24 they are now available to all Go developers.
These new features are the 
function, which queues up a function to
run when an object is no longer reachable, and the 
type, which safely points to an object without
preventing it from being garbage collected.
Together, these two features are powerful enough to build your own 
package!
Let’s dig into what makes these features useful, and when to use them.Note: these new features are advanced features of the garbage collector.
If you’re not already familiar with basic garbage collection concepts, we
strongly recommend reading the introduction of our garbage collector
guide.If you’ve ever used a finalizer, then the concept of a cleanup will be
familiar.
A finalizer is a function, associated with an allocated object by calling
, that is later
called by the garbage collector some time after the object becomes unreachable.
At a high level, cleanups work the same way.Let’s consider an application that makes use of a memory-mapped file, and see
how cleanups can help.//go:build unix

type MemoryMappedFile struct {
    data []byte
}

func NewMemoryMappedFile(filename string) (*MemoryMappedFile, error) {
    f, err := os.Open(filename)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    defer f.Close()

    // Get the file's info; we need its size.
    fi, err := f.Stat()
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    // Extract the file descriptor.
    conn, err := f.SyscallConn()
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    var data []byte
    connErr := conn.Control(func(fd uintptr) {
        // Create a memory mapping backed by this file.
        data, err = syscall.Mmap(int(fd), 0, int(fi.Size()), syscall.PROT_READ, syscall.MAP_SHARED)
    })
    if connErr != nil {
        return nil, connErr
    }
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    mf := &MemoryMappedFile{data: data}
    cleanup := func(data []byte) {
        syscall.Munmap(data) // ignore error
    }
    runtime.AddCleanup(mf, cleanup, data)
    return mf, nil
}
A memory-mapped file has its contents mapped to memory, in this case, the
underlying data of a byte slice.
Thanks to operating-system magic, reads and writes to the byte slice directly
access the contents of the file.
With this code, we can pass around a , and when it’s
no longer referenced, the memory mapping we created will get cleaned up.Notice that  takes three arguments: the address of a
variable to attach the cleanup to, the cleanup function itself, and an argument
to the cleanup function.
A key difference between this function and  is that the
cleanup function takes a different argument than the object we’re attaching the
cleanup to.
This change fixes some problems with finalizers.It’s no secret that finalizers
are difficult to use correctly.
For example, objects to which finalizers are attached must not be involved
in any reference cycles (even a pointer to itself is too much!), otherwise the
object will never be reclaimed and the finalizer will never run, causing a
leak.
Finalizers also significantly delay reclamation of memory.
It takes at a minumum two full garbage collection cycles to reclaim the
memory for a finalized object: one to determine that it’s unreachable, and
another to determine that it’s still unreachable after the finalizer
executes.The problem is that finalizers resurrect the objects they’re attached
to.
The finalizer doesn’t run until the object is unreachable, at which point it is
considered “dead.”
But since the finalizer is called with a pointer to the object, the garbage
collector must prevent the reclamation of that object’s memory, and instead must
generate a new reference for the finalizer, making it reachable, or “live,” once
more.
That reference may even remain after the finalizer returns, for example if the
finalizer writes it to a global variable or sends it across a channel.
Object resurrection is problematic because it means the object, and everything
it points to, and everything those objects point to, and so on, is reachable,
even if it would otherwise have been collected as garbage.We solve both of these problems by not passing the original object to the
cleanup function.
First, the values the object refers to don’t need to be kept specially
reachable by the garbage collector, so the object can still be reclaimed even
if it’s involved in a cycle.
Second, since the object is not needed for the cleanup, its memory can be
reclaimed immediately.Returning to our memory-mapped file example, suppose we notice that our program
frequently maps the same files over and over, from different goroutines that are
unaware of each other.
This is fine from a memory perspective, since all these mappings will share
physical memory, but it results in lots of unnecessary system calls to map and
unmap the file.
This is especially bad if each goroutine reads only a small section of each
file.So, let’s deduplicate the mappings by filename.
(Let’s assume that our program only reads from the mappings, and the files
themselves are never modified or renamed once created.
Such assumptions are reasonable for system font files, for example.)We could maintain a map from filename to memory mapping, but then it becomes
unclear when it’s safe to remove entries from that map.
We could  use a cleanup, if it weren’t for the fact that the map entry
itself will keep the memory-mapped file object alive.Weak pointers solve this problem.
A weak pointer is a special kind of pointer that the garbage collector ignores
when deciding whether an object is reachable.
Go 1.24’s new weak pointer type,
, has a  method that
returns either a real pointer if the object is still reachable, or  if it
is not.If we instead maintain a map that only  points to the memory-mapped
file, we can clean up the map entry when nobody’s using it anymore!
Let’s see what this looks like.var cache sync.Map // map[string]weak.Pointer[MemoryMappedFile]

func NewCachedMemoryMappedFile(filename string) (*MemoryMappedFile, error) {
    var newFile *MemoryMappedFile
    for {
        // Try to load an existing value out of the cache.
        value, ok := cache.Load(filename)
        if !ok {
            // No value found. Create a new mapped file if needed.
            if newFile == nil {
                var err error
                newFile, err = NewMemoryMappedFile(filename)
                if err != nil {
                    return nil, err
                }
            }

            // Try to install the new mapped file.
            wp := weak.Make(newFile)
            var loaded bool
            value, loaded = cache.LoadOrStore(filename, wp)
            if !loaded {
                runtime.AddCleanup(newFile, func(filename string) {
                    // Only delete if the weak pointer is equal. If it's not, someone
                    // else already deleted the entry and installed a new mapped file.
                    cache.CompareAndDelete(filename, wp)
                }, filename)
                return newFile, nil
            }
            // Someone got to installing the file before us.
            //
            // If it's still there when we check in a moment, we'll discard newFile
            // and it'll get cleaned up by garbage collector.
        }

        // See if our cache entry is valid.
        if mf := value.(weak.Pointer[MemoryMappedFile]).Value(); mf != nil {
            return mf, nil
        }

        // Discovered a nil entry awaiting cleanup. Eagerly delete it.
        cache.CompareAndDelete(filename, value)
    }
}
This example is a little complicated, but the gist is simple.
We start with a global concurrent map of all the mapped files we made.
NewCachedMemoryMappedFile consults this map for an existing mapped
file, and if that fails, creates and tries to insert a new mapped file.
This could of course fail as well since we’re racing with other insertions, so
we need to be careful about that too, and retry.
(This design has a flaw in that we might wastefully map the same file multiple
times in a race, and we’ll have to throw it away via the cleanup added by
.
This is probably not a big deal most of the time.
Fixing it is left as an exercise for the reader.)Let’s look at some useful properties of weak pointers and cleanups exploited by
this code.Firstly, notice that weak pointers are comparable.
Not only that, weak pointers have a stable and independent identity, which
remains even after the objects they point to are long gone.
This is why it is safe for the cleanup function to call ’s
, which compares the , and a crucial reason
this code works at all.Secondly, observe that we can add multiple independent cleanups to a single
 object.
This allows us to use cleanups in a composable way and use them to build
generic data structures.
In this particular example, it might be more efficient to combine
NewCachedMemoryMappedFile with  and
have them share a cleanup.
However, the advantage of the code we wrote above is that it can be rewritten
in a generic way!type Cache[K comparable, V any] struct {
    create func(K) (*V, error)
    m     sync.Map
}

func NewCache[K comparable, V any](create func(K) (*V, error)) *Cache[K, V] {
    return &Cache[K, V]{create: create}
}

func (c *Cache[K, V]) Get(key K) (*V, error) {
    var newValue *V
    for {
        // Try to load an existing value out of the cache.
        value, ok := cache.Load(key)
        if !ok {
            // No value found. Create a new mapped file if needed.
            if newValue == nil {
                var err error
                newValue, err = c.create(key)
                if err != nil {
                    return nil, err
                }
            }

            // Try to install the new mapped file.
            wp := weak.Make(newValue)
            var loaded bool
            value, loaded = cache.LoadOrStore(key, wp)
            if !loaded {
                runtime.AddCleanup(newValue, func(key K) {
                    // Only delete if the weak pointer is equal. If it's not, someone
                    // else already deleted the entry and installed a new mapped file.
                    cache.CompareAndDelete(key, wp)
                }, key)
                return newValue, nil
            }
        }

        // See if our cache entry is valid.
        if mf := value.(weak.Pointer[V]).Value(); mf != nil {
            return mf, nil
        }

        // Discovered a nil entry awaiting cleanup. Eagerly delete it.
        cache.CompareAndDelete(key, value)
    }
}
Despite our best efforts, cleanups and weak pointers can still be error-prone.
To guide those considering using finalizers, cleanups, and weak pointers, we
recently updated the guide to the garbage
collector with some advice
about using these features.
Take a look next time you reach for them, but also carefully consider whether
you need to use them at all.
These are advanced tools with subtle semantics and, as the guide says, most
Go code benefits from these features indirectly, not from using them directly.
Stick to the use-cases where these features shine, and you’ll be alright.For now, we’ll call out some of the issues that you are more likely to run into.First, the object the cleanup is attached to must be reachable from neither
the cleanup function (as a captured variable) nor the argument to the cleanup
function.
Both of these situations result in the cleanup never executing.
(In the special case of the cleanup argument being exactly the pointer passed
to ,  will panic, as a signal to the
caller that they should not use cleanups the same way as finalizers.)Second, when weak pointers are used as map keys, the weakly referenced object
must not be reachable from the corresponding map value, otherwise the object
will continue to remain live.
This may seem obvious when deep inside of a blog post about weak pointers, but
it’s an easy subtlety to miss.
This problem inspired the entire concept of an
ephemeron to resolve it, which is a
potential future direction.Thirdly, a common pattern with cleanups is that a wrapper object is needed, like
we see here with our  example.
In this particular case, you could imagine the garbage collector directly
tracking the mapped memory region and passing around the inner .
Such functionality is possible future work, and an API for it has been recently
proposed.Lastly, both weak pointers and cleanups are inherently non-deterministic, their
behavior depending intimately on the design and dynamics of the garbage
collector.
The documentation for cleanups even permits the garbage collector never to run
cleanups at all.
Effectively testing code that uses them can be tricky, but it is
possible.Weak pointers have been brought up as a feature for Go since nearly the
beginning, but for years were not prioritized by the Go team.
One reason for that is that they are subtle, and the design space of weak
pointers is a minefield of decisions that can make them even harder to use.
Another is that weak pointers are a niche tool, while simultaneously adding
complexity to the language.
We already had experience with how painful  could be to use.
But there are some useful programs that are not expressible without them, and
the  package and the reasons for its existence really emphasized that.With generics, the hindsight of finalizers, and insights from all the great work
since done by teams in other languages like C# and Java, the designs for weak
pointers and cleanups came together quickly.
The desire to use weak pointers with finalizers raised additional questions,
and so the design for  quickly came together as well.I want to thank everyone in the community who contributed feedback on the
proposal issues and filed bugs when the features became available.
I also want to thank David Chase for thoroughly thinking through weak
pointer semantics with me, and I want to thank him, Russ Cox, and Austin
Clements for their help with the design of .
I want to thank Carlos Amedee for his work on getting 
implemented, polished, landed for Go 1.24.
And finally I want to thank Carlos Amedee and Ian Lance Taylor for their work
replacing  with  throughout the
standard library for Go 1.25.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>White Boy Summer</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpO2dFPcNEo</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/DpO2dFPcNEo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Mar 2025 23:28:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Kelly J.

The game's main conceit was based loosely on the Chinese literary classic The Water Margin: A young outcast and his friends gather up companions to form the 108 Stars of Destiny, building a magnificent rebel outpost and eventually toppling a wicked empire. Suikoden's success would inspire multiple sequels, including immediate follow-up Suikoden II, regarded by many as a shining gem in the PS1's RPG library.With fame and acclaim, however, comes a price tag: Original copies of Suikoden II run in the hundreds of dollars, and that's even with several well-known, game-breaking bugs that were inadvertently introduced in the English version. Here's where Konami seemingly swoops in to the rescue, offering both Suikoden I and II together for a low price and promising beautiful new HD graphics and bonus features. This was announced back in 2022, and now, two and a half years later due to delays, we finally have Suikoden I&II HD Remaster--and I'm left wondering just how all that time this remaster spent cooking in the oven was spent.First, let's talk a bit about the games themselves. I first played both of these titles back on the PS1 many years ago. The original Suikoden was the game I was most excited to revisit, as it had been well over two decades since I'd last played it, and I'd forgotten so much about it. I was pleased to rediscover a pleasant, breezy RPG with a fast-paced story, smooth turn-based combat, and a charming sense of humor. It's quite short, and with the lack of load times and addition of battle speed-up options, you can easily finish it in around 15-20 hours doing all of the optional content.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Barcelona by Bike!

It relies on protocols such as Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)  , Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)  , and Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)  to establish direct connections across varied network environments. While its foundational mechanics are well-documented, practical implementation reveals subtleties in areas like NAT traversal, signaling, DataChannel management, and congestion control that can impact performance and reliability. This post examines core concepts and technical details for developers building WebRTC applications.Signaling and Initial Connection SetupWebRTC relies on an out-of-band signaling channel to coordinate the initial connection between peers, a mechanism not prescribed by the W3C WebRTC 1.0 specification but essential for exchanging Session Description Protocol (SDP) offers, answers, and ICE candidates, as outlined in  . SDP, a format for describing session parameters like codecs and transport options, is typically transmitted over a WebSocket connection to a centralized server in most deployments, the. This choice reflects WebSockets’ support for real-time, bidirectional communication, making them well-suited for the low-latency requirements of WebRTC signaling, but it can be any equivalent. The process begins with one peer generating an SDP offer via the CreateOffer() method, committing it locally with SetLocalDescription(), and sending it to the remote peer through the signaling connection. The receiving peer applies this offer as its remote description using SetRemoteDescription(), generates an answer with CreateAnswer(), sets it locally, and returns it. Once both peers have established their local and remote descriptions, they exchange ICE candidates—network endpoint details like IP addresses and ports—to finalize the connection.Peer A creates offer with CreateOffer()Peer A sets offer locally with SetLocalDescription()Peer A sends offer via the siganling connection to Peer BPeer B sets offer as remote with SetRemoteDescription(), sends answer backPeer A sets answer as remote with SetRemoteDescription()While WebSockets dominate due to their efficiency, alternatives like HTTP polling or REST APIs can serve simpler use cases, though their request-response model introduces measurable latency, often on the order of tens to hundreds of milliseconds depending on network conditions. By contrast, Magic Wormhole provides a non-WebRTC example, using a rendezvous server to facilitate P2P setup with its own encrypted transport, distinct from WebRTC’s ICE-based approach. In practice, WebRTC applications favor WebSockets or similar protocols for their balance of practicality and performance.PeerConnection and DataChannel Multiplexing*The RTCPeerConnection object, as defined in  , manages WebRTC’s transport layer, overseeing ICE negotiation, DTLS encryption, and the SCTP association for DataChannels. A single PeerConnection can multiplex multiple streams, making it efficient to handle diverse communication types, een text messaging, file transfers, or telemetry—within one instance. Establishing additional PeerConnections incurs overhead: ICE negotiation takes 100-500 milliseconds depending on network conditions and candidate gathering, DTLS handshakes often require 50-200 milliseconds for key exchange, and SCTP setup adds further delay. Multiplexing DataChannels avoids these costs, centralizing transport management and reducing signaling complexity.DataChannels operate over a single SCTP association within a PeerConnection, identified by 16-bit stream IDs (0-65535) as specified in  . After the initial SDP negotiation establishes the SCTP association, new DataChannels can be created dynamically using CreateDataChannel() without additional offer/answer exchanges, a feature enabled by WebRTC’s design (W3C WebRTC 1.0, Section 6.3 ). When one peer creates a DataChannel, the remote peer receives it via the OnDataChannel event, allowing immediate handler attachment. If both peers independently create DataChannels with the same label, WebRTC treats them as distinct unless explicitly coordinated with the negotiated: true option and a matching id, an option available for specific synchronization use cases. All DataChannels share SCTP’s congestion control, meaning high traffic on one channel—such as a multi-megabyte file transfer—can reduce throughput for others, a behavior governed by the SCTP congestion algorithms, occasionally necessitating data rate management.Using multiple PeerConnections is warranted only in specific cases: isolating traffic, routing through distinct TURN relays for redundancy, or separating streams for diagnostic clarity. Otherwise, a single PeerConnection is preferable. If all DataChannels close and no media tracks remain, the PeerConnection persists per the specification, but some implementations (e.g., older browsers) may terminate it after an idle timeout, typically 5-60 seconds, unless keep-alive traffic maintains activity. A low-bandwidth DataChannel sending periodic messages can mitigate this risk, ensuring the connection remains available for future use.ICE, NAT Traversal, and STUN/TURN MechanicsICE enables WebRTC to traverse Network Address Translators (NATs) by systematically evaluating network paths. It gathers candidates from local interfaces (host candidates), STUN servers (server-reflexive candidates), and TURN relays (relay candidates), testing them to establish connectivity. , formalized in  , sends candidates incrementally as they are discovered, allowing peers to begin connectivity checks immediately — typically reducing setup time by 50–200 milliseconds compared to Full ICE, which collects all candidates before SDP exchange. Most WebRTC implementations default to Trickle ICE for its efficiency nowadays.STUN servers, per  , query a peer’s public IP and port mapping behind a NAT, assuming the NAT permits some inbound traffic via techniques like UDP hole punching. This fails with Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT), where ISPs assign multiple users a shared public IP and block inbound connections, rendering direct P2P infeasible. TURN servers, defined in  , address this by relaying all traffic: both peers establish outbound connections to the same TURN server, which proxies data between them. This process doubles bandwidth usage — for a 1Mbps stream, the TURN server handles 1Mbps inbound and 1Mbps outbound — making it resource-intensive and costly compared to STUN’s lightweight discovery role. TURN servers must be identical for both peers to form a relay path, whereas STUN servers can differ since they only provide mapping data, a distinction rooted in their respective protocol designs.Candidate exchange timing is important: candidates are gathered only  SetLocalDescription() commits the local SDP, ensuring ICE’s state machine progresses correctly. The remote peer processes candidates after SetRemoteDescription(), though some implementations (e.g., browsers like Chrome) buffer early candidates, while others (e.g.,  ) may discard them, leading to potential connectivity delays if not synchronized properly.Peer A sets local description, starts gathering candidatesPeer A sends candidate to Peer B when OnIceCandidate firesPeer B sets remote description, processes candidatePeer B sends its candidate back to Peer ABoth peers connect using received candidatesDataChannel Lifecycle and the OnOpen() ChallengeDataChannels introduce lifecycle considerations, notably with the OnOpen() event, which fires when the local system deems the SCTP stream usable (W3C WebRTC 1.0, Section 6.3). This does not confirm remote readiness; the remote peer may not have attached an OnMessage handler, risking data loss if messages are sent immediately. In cases where data loss is a concern, consider a handshake after OnOpen() and before transmitting substantive data. This ensures both peers—and any external logic, like TCP-to-WebRTC bridges—are fully initialized, aligning with observed best practices in WebRTC deployments.Messages arriving before OnMessage is set are buffered by SCTP, but the buffer size varies by implementation—typically 256KB in browsers like Chrome and Firefox, configurable in libraries like Pion via MaxMessageSize. If this buffer overflows due to delayed handler attachment, older messages are dropped, necessitating prompt handler setup or application-level buffering for critical payloads. Post-connection, new DataChannels trigger OnDataChannel on the remote peer without signaling, leveraging the existing SCTP association. Closing all DataChannels leaves the PeerConnection intact, allowing later creation, though NAT timeouts (15-60 seconds per  ) or implementation-specific idle policies may necessitate keep-alive messages.Peer A and B complete initial connection setupPeer A creates DataChannel “chat” with CreateDataChannel()Peer A’s OnOpen fires, channel is ready locallyPeer B’s OnDataChannel fires, detects “chat”Peer B’s OnOpen fires, channel is readySCTP: Data Framing, Congestion, and ReliabilityDataChannels utilize SCTP over DTLS, offering reliable, message-oriented transport distinct from TCP’s stream model or UDP’s unreliability, per RFC 4960 and RFC 8832. SCTP preserves message boundaries, delivering complete payloads to OnMessage without reassembly. Browser implementations cap Send() at approximately 16MB (e.g., Chrome’s WebRTC internals), while SCTP’s default send/receive buffer is around 256KB, adjustable in libraries like Pion. Messages exceeding this buffer can block transmission, requiring manual chunking, e.g., into 64KB segments with sequence IDs, followed by reassembly on receipt, signaled by a final small packet.SCTP’s congestion control operates across all DataChannels in a PeerConnection, throttling sends based on network feedback like round-trip time and packet loss. Heavy traffic on one channel can degrade others, a shared constraint observable via the BufferedAmount() API. The OnBufferedAmountLow() event fires when the send buffer drops below a threshold (default 64KB in Pion), guiding pacing to avoid overflow, which can force channel closure in extreme cases. Unlike TCP, SCTP lacks guaranteed delivery if the PeerConnection fails mid-transfer; dropped messages require application-level acknowledgments, such as sequence number tracking, to ensure reliability for critical data.Maintaining Connection StabilityNetwork dynamics challenge WebRTC’s stability, particularly with NATs and firewalls. UDP NAT mappings expire after 15–60 seconds of inactivity (RFC 4787), necessitating keep-alive messages — e.g., a “ping” every 5–30 seconds via a DataChannel — to sustain bindings. TURN servers impose their own timeouts, often configurable (e.g., 10 minutes in Coturn), requiring periodic traffic to maintain relay sessions. Network changes, such as switching from Wi-Fi to cellular, may disrupt connectivity, addressable by an ICE restart — renegotiating SDP to update candidates per RFC 8835. Logging PeerConnectionState transitions (“connected” to “disconnected” to “failed”) identifies these disruptions, enabling recovery actions like re-establishing the connection or switching to TURN.Peer A sends STUN candidate, no responsePeer B can’t connect via STUN (e.g., CGNAT)Peer A switches to TURN server candidatePeer B uses same TURN server candidateConnection works through TURN relay Debugging and Optimization StrategiesDebugging hinges on comprehensive logging. Monitoring PeerConnectionState tracks connection lifecycle events, while OnIceCandidate verifies candidate exchange—missing candidates often signal NAT traversal failures resolvable with TURN or refined STUN configurations. The OnBufferedAmountLow() callback detects congestion when BufferedAmount() exceeds typical thresholds (e.g., 256KB), indicating a slow receiver. Optimization includes reducing ICE setup time by limiting STUN queries (e.g., one server per region) or prioritizing host candidates, though this risks connectivity if NAT traversal fails. For TURN, short-lived credentials (e.g., 24-hour expiry) and bandwidth caps control costs, while tuning SCTP’s MaxMessageSize (default 256KB in Pion) supports high-throughput use cases, balancing performance with reliability.PeerConnectionState changes to “connecting”OnIceCandidate shows new candidatePeerConnectionState changes to “connected”OnDataChannel detects new channelOnBufferedAmountLow shows buffer statusWebRTC provides a robust framework for P2P communication, requiring however signaling over e.g. WebSockets. Applications need to be designed with considerations for multiplexing DataChannels, managing ICE and NAT traversal, handling SCTP congestion, and ensuring connection stability each require deliberate attention. Keep in mind that WebRTC is primarily used for real-time peer-to-peer communication in applications like video conferencing, voice calls, live streaming, and data sharing, but it is not suitable for broadcasting, persistent background tasks, or bulk data transfers.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A 1940s Sweet Treat!</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjfCagi35IM</link><author>Imperial War Museums</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/bjfCagi35IM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Mar 2025 12:01:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3uAjWoLZ4bSi6qI9SjALxA">Imperial War Museums</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A clip from the Ministry of Food's WW2 rationing adverts: "Food Flashes".

But this isn’t just a story about technology—it’s about the people shaping it, the competing ideologies driving them, and the enormous consequences of getting this right (or wrong).

For a long time, AI was something most people didn’t have to think about, but that’s no longer the case. The decisions being made right now—about who controls AI, how it’s trained, and what it should or shouldn’t be allowed to do—are already changing the world.
The people trying to build these systems don’t agree on what should happen next – or even on what exactly it is they’re creating. Some call it artificial general intelligence (AGI), others refer to it as “the magic intelligence in the sky.” OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, has even compared it to creating a god.

But whether AI is a true existential risk or just another overhyped tech trend, one thing is certain: the stakes are getting higher, and the fight over what kind of intelligence we’re building is only beginning.

The backbone were its superbly trained legions, with excellent equipment, training and motivation. They used to be conscripted citizens in the Republic proper, but became long-serving professionals by Casaer's day, when he achieved the ultimate triumph over the long-rival cents by conquering Gaul. They were however accompanied by a comparable number of 'auxiliaries', troop recruited from conquered people without citizenship, paid half and given the dirty jobs, but eager to win the status of full Roman. Under the Empire, the army gradually evolved, including weapons and recruitment. The Germanic tries proved the ultimate challenge, their forest homelands impossible to conquer by established Riman tactics, Varrus even incurred an unprecedented defeat. Ultimately they and other 'barbarians', having learned a lot from Rome, would overrun it.

These establishments were especially important for those who didn’t have kitchens at home, offering pre-prepared food like grilled meats, vegetables, cheese, and even heated wine. The thermopolia were found near busy urban areas like the forum and the baths, providing a quick and affordable dining experience for Romans on the go.

We visit Ostia Antica, the port city of Rome, where frescoes still depict typical menu items, such as olives, eggs, and cheese. These establishments also featured large jars of wine, grills, and sometimes patios for customers to relax while enjoying their meals. Fast food joints in ancient Rome were fun, quick, and cheap, similar to modern street food.

Life in Ancient Times with Darius Arya

More on Ancient Roman Fast Food
Shopping at outdoor markets, like the Campo de' Fiori in Rome, was also a major part of daily life. Just like in antiquity, locals would come to these markets to buy fresh produce like chicory, beans, and figs. Roman cuisine, often simple and reliant on staples such as legumes and leafy greens, reflected the broader Mediterranean diet.

For those who couldn’t afford proper apartments, cooking at home was risky due to fire hazards and the lack of chimneys. This meant many residents of insulas—multi-story buildings in Rome—relied on nearby bars and eateries for their daily meals. The episode also delves into Pompeii, where paintings in a bar depict patrons enjoying wine and rolling dice, giving us a glimpse of the vibrant social life centered around these dining establishments.

Fish and seafood were also popular in Roman cuisine. The Romans loved octopus, squid, sardines, and more, which they often paired with garum, a fermented fish sauce that acted as a condiment much like ketchup today. Markets like the Mercato di Testaccio in modern Rome continue the ancient tradition of offering quick, flavorful meals, giving us a taste of how Romans ate thousands of years ago.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CNCF Deaf and Hard of Hearing WG at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2024</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8bb_SkDxQ</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/bY8bb_SkDxQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Mar 2025 19:55:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Paul Mecurio explore the cutting-edge science of plasma physics and fusion energy with Fatima Ebrahimi, a physicist at Princeton Plasma Physics Lab.

We begin by breaking down the basics: What is plasma, and why is it essential for fusion? From the glowing plasma balls at novelty stores to the fusion reactions powering the sun, we explore how charged particles interact and what it takes to heat plasma to fusion-level temperatures.

Fusion research has been ongoing for decades, but when will we finally achieve break-even energy? Fatima explains the different fusion approaches—from Princeton’s tokamak designs to Livermore’s laser-driven experiments—and why density, temperature, and magnetic fields play a crucial role. We discuss the major breakthroughs, the challenge of scaling fusion for commercial energy production, and whether we are truly just a decade away from a fusion-powered future.

But fusion isn’t just about energy—it’s also key to the next generation of space travel. Learn about plasma propulsion: Could this ultra-efficient rocket technology one day take us to Mars and beyond? We explore how fusion-powered spacecraft could revolutionize deep-space exploration, the challenges of decelerating at high speeds, and whether future missions will rely on in-space refueling using hydrogen from the cosmos.

Finally, we take a cosmic perspective on the patience and persistence required for scientific progress. Will fusion power be ready in our lifetime? What role will AI play in accelerating breakthroughs? All this and more in a charged-up episode of StarTalk!

--

Achinpur was on the precipice of demonic takeover. A mysterious woman beguiled the king and infiltrated the royal family. But she wasn’t human; under her beautiful façade lurked an insatiable appetite for flesh. One night, the demon queen devoured the king's sons — but the princes managed to evade death. Malay Bera shares the tale of their quest to free the kingdom from the scourge of demons.

Lesson by Malay Bera, directed by Ahmad Thabit, Samaka Studio.

Although this folktale exists in multiple oral variants across the Bengali-speaking world, this video is based on a variant akin to the better-known literary version, "Neelkamal and Lalkamal",  from Thakurmar Jhuli (1907), an anthology of Bengali folktales collected by Dakshinaranjan Mitra Majumdar in the early 20th century.

It's the type of game that will have you setting your controller aside to wipe away tears, both of laughter and raw emotion, as well as to call literally everyone in close proximity to come see whatever dark, hilarious, referential, or mind-blowing thing just happened. As such, I've spent the better part of the past week impatiently waiting for this embargo to drop--for the second I could talk about it with someone other than the close friend I roped into joining me. In short, Split Fiction is one of the most memorable, brilliant, and spectacular games I've ever played. And at long last, I am allowed to tell about it.With Split Fiction, Hazelight Studios solidifies itself as not only one of the most clever and innovative working studios, but as one eager to grow and utterly devoted to creativity as both an idea and act. Though Hazelight has yet to release anything less than great, it was almost shocking to see how much it had learned from--and improved upon--2021's critical darling It Takes Two. Levels and environments are vast, gorgeous, and varied; our two protagonists, Mio and Zoe, are full of depth, charm, and personality; the game's seemingly endless gimmicks and gameplay mechanics, all of which are introduced at far more rapid pace than It Takes Two, are nearly all so fun, brilliant, and tightly designed that they could stand alone; and its writing, plot beats, and overall structure deliver a remarkable story that rappels from heart wrenching, commentative, darkly humorous, and brimming with joy just as fluidly as our heroines grapple-hook between buildings. Though there is a level of cheesiness that coats the game's overarching story and its primary antagonist, Rader, as a whole Split Fiction is a marvelous game that sets a new benchmark not only for Hazelight, but for co-op experiences as a whole.Despite its inevitable greatness, Split Fiction kicks off with a humble (if slightly cliched) beginning in which it introduces its protagonists: Mio Hudson and Zoe Foster. Mio and Zoe are nothing alike. Whereas Mio is an angsty, city-slicking, sci-fi enthusiast who'd sooner yank out her own tooth than open up to a stranger, the fantasy-loving Zoe is sunshine incarnate. And yet, the pair does share one thing in common: They are both unpublished writers in dire need of money and a byline.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What Niche Do Humans Occupy?

Users in distant regions experience significant latency, slow load times, and frustrating buffering issues. The farther they are from your server, the longer it takes for data to travel across the network, degrading their experience.To fix this, you need a way to bring your content physically closer to your users, reducing the distance data must travel.This is exactly what a Content Delivery Network (CDN) does.In this article, we will explore what a CDN is, how it works, its benefits, different use-cases, and popular CDN providers.If you’re finding this newsletter valuable and want to deepen your learning, consider becoming a .As a paid subscriber, you'll receive an exclusive deep-dive article every week, access to a structured100+topics and interview questions, and other .A CDN is a geographically distributed network of servers that work together to deliver  (like HTML pages, JavaScript files, stylesheets, images, and videos) to users based on their .The primary purpose of a CDN is to deliver content to end-users with  and  by reducing the physical distance between the server and the user.When a user requests content from a website, the CDN redirects the request to the nearest server in its network,  and A  operates using three key components: – The primary servers where the original content is stored. – Directs user requests to the nearest edge server instead of the origin server.By leveraging edge servers distributed across multiple geographical regions, CDNs minimize latency and accelerate content delivery. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how a CDN works: – A user visits a website and requests content, such as an image, a webpage, or a video. This request must be  that can serve the content. – The browser  to resolve the web content address (e.g., https://cdn.example.com/images/logo.png) into an IP address. The DNS return the nearest CDN edge server’s IP address rather than the origin server.If the content is  at the edge server, it is served immediately to the user.If not, the edge server forwards the request to the origin server. The origin server processes the request and  to the edge server. The edge server caches the content it retrieved from the origin server. – Once cached, future requests for the same content are served directly from the edge server, reducing load on the origin and improving speed.CDNs use a Time-to-Live (TTL) mechanism to determine how long content remains cached before expiring. To ensure users always receive the latest version, CDNs periodically refresh and update cached content from the origin server. – By serving content from the nearest edge server, CDNs reduce latency and improve page load speed. – CDNs offload traffic from the origin server by caching static assets, reducing resource consumption.Improved Availability and Reliability – With multiple servers in different locations, CDNs prevent single points of failure.: CDNs can handle traffic spikes more efficiently than traditional hosting, making them ideal for websites with fluctuating traffic patterns.: CDNs make it easier to deliver content to users worldwide, regardless of their location. – Many CDNs offer DDoS protection, Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), and bot mitigation to secure applications.While CDNs offer many benefits, it’s important to note that they also introduce some challenges like: Integrating a CDN requires proper DNS configuration, cache rules, and content invalidation policies.Many CDN providers charge based on bandwidth usage and request volume. For high-traffic websites, CDN costs , especially for video streaming, gaming, and software distribution.Accelerating Website PerformanceWebsites with  use CDNs to ensure  for users regardless of location.

Let’s start with some introductions, could you tell us a
bit about yourself, your role and how you got involved in Kubernetes. Hello, I am Benjamin. I am a SIG etcd Tech Lead and one of the etcd maintainers. I
work for VMware, which is part of the Broadcom group. I got involved in Kubernetes & etcd & CSI
(Container Storage Interface)
because of work and also a big passion for open source. I have been working on Kubernetes & etcd
(and also CSI) since 2020. Hey team, I’m James, a co-chair for SIG etcd and etcd maintainer. I work at Red Hat as a
Specialist Architect helping people adopt cloud native technology. I got involved with the
Kubernetes ecosystem in 2019. Around the end of 2022 I noticed how the etcd community and project
needed help so started contributing as often as I could. There is a saying in our community that
"you come for the technology, and stay for the people": for me this is absolutely real, it’s been a
wonderful journey so far and I’m excited to support our community moving forward. Hey everyone, I'm Marek, the SIG etcd lead. At Google, I lead the GKE etcd team, ensuring
a stable and reliable experience for all GKE users. My Kubernetes journey began with SIG
Instrumentation, where I
created and led the Kubernetes Structured Logging effort.
I'm still the main project lead for Kubernetes Metrics Server,
providing crucial signals for autoscaling in Kubernetes. I started working on etcd 3 years ago,
right around the 3.5 release. We faced some challenges, but I'm thrilled to see etcd now the most
scalable and reliable it's ever been, with the highest contribution numbers in the project's
history. I'm passionate about distributed systems, extreme programming, and testing. Hi there, my name is Wenjia, I am the co-chair of SIG etcd and one of the etcd
maintainers. I work at Google as an Engineering Manager, working on GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)
and GDC (Google Distributed Cloud). I have been working in the area of open source Kubernetes and
etcd since the Kubernetes v1.10 and etcd v3.1 releases. I got involved in Kubernetes because of my
job, but what keeps me in the space is the charm of the container orchestration technology, and more
importantly, the awesome open source community.Frederico: Excellent, thank you. I'd like to start with the origin of the SIG itself: SIG etcd is
a very recent SIG, could you quickly go through the history and reasons behind its creation?: Absolutely! SIG etcd was formed because etcd is a critical component of Kubernetes,
serving as its data store. However, etcd was facing challenges like maintainer turnover and
reliability issues. Creating a dedicated SIG
allowed us to focus on addressing these problems, improving development and maintenance processes,
and ensuring etcd evolves in sync with the cloud-native landscape.Frederico: And has becoming a SIG worked out as expected? Better yet, are the motivations you just
described being addressed, and to what extent?: It's been a positive change overall. Becoming a SIG has brought more structure and
transparency to etcd's development. We've adopted Kubernetes processes like KEPs
(Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals
and PRRs (Production Readiness Reviews,
which has improved our feature development and release cycle.Frederico: On top of those, what would you single out as the major benefit that has resulted from
becoming a SIG?: The biggest benefits for me was adopting Kubernetes testing infrastructure, tools like
Prow and TestGrid. For large projects like
etcd there is just no comparison to the default GitHub tooling. Having known, easy to use, clear
tools is a major boost to the etcd as it makes it much easier for Kubernetes contributors to also
help etcd.: Totally agree, while challenges remain, the SIG structure provides a solid foundation
for addressing them and ensuring etcd's continued success as a critical component of the Kubernetes
ecosystem.The positive impact on the community is another crucial aspect of SIG etcd's success that I’d like
to highlight. The Kubernetes SIG structure has created a welcoming environment for etcd
contributors, leading to increased participation from the broader Kubernetes community. We have had
greater collaboration with other SIGs like SIG API
Machinery,
SIG Scalability,
SIG Testing,
SIG Cluster Lifecycle, etc.This collaboration helps ensure etcd's development aligns with the needs of the wider Kubernetes
ecosystem. The formation of the etcd Operator Working Group
under the joint effort between SIG etcd and SIG Cluster Lifecycle exemplifies this successful
collaboration, demonstrating a shared commitment to improving etcd's operational aspects within
Kubernetes.Frederico: Since you mentioned collaboration, have you seen changes in terms of contributors and
community involvement in recent months?: Yes -- as showing in our
unique PR author data
we recently hit an all time high in March and are trending in a positive direction:Frederico: That's quite telling, thank you. In terms of the near future, what are the current
priorities for SIG etcd?: Reliability is always top of mind -– we need to make sure etcd is rock-solid. We're also
working on making etcd easier to use and manage for operators. And we have our sights set on making
etcd a viable standalone solution for infrastructure management, not just for Kubernetes. Oh, and of
course, scaling -– we need to ensure etcd can handle the growing demands of the cloud-native world.: I agree that reliability should always be our top guiding principle. We need to ensure
not only correctness but also compatibility. Additionally, we should continuously strive to improve
the understandability and maintainability of etcd. Our focus should be on addressing the pain points
that the community cares about the most.Frederico: Are there any specific SIGs that you work closely with?: SIG API Machinery, for sure – they own the structure of the data etcd stores, so we're
constantly working together. And SIG Cluster Lifecycle – etcd is a key part of Kubernetes clusters,
so we collaborate on the newly created etcd operator Working group.: Other than SIG API Machinery and SIG Cluster Lifecycle that Marek mentioned above, SIG
Scalability and SIG Testing is another group that we work closely with.Frederico: In a more general sense, how would you list the key challenges for SIG etcd in the
evolving cloud native landscape?: Well, reliability is always a challenge when you're dealing with critical data. The
cloud-native world is evolving so fast that scaling to meet those demands is a constant effort.Frederico: We're almost at the end of our conversation, but for those interested in in etcd, how
can they get involved?: We'd love to have them! The best way to start is to join our
SIG etcd meetings,
follow discussions on the etcd-dev mailing list, and check
out our GitHub issues. We're always looking for people to
review proposals, test code, and contribute to documentation.: I love this question 😀 . There are numerous ways for people interested in contributing
to SIG etcd to get involved and make a difference. Here are some key areas where you can help:: Tackle existing issues in the etcd codebase. Start with issues labeled "good first
issue" or "help wanted" to find tasks that are suitable for newcomers.: Contribute to the development of new features and enhancements. Check the
etcd roadmap and discussions to see what's being planned and where your skills might fit in.: Help ensure the quality of etcd by writing tests, reviewing code
changes, and providing feedback.: Improve etcd's documentation by adding new content,
clarifying existing information, or fixing errors. Clear and comprehensive documentation is
essential for users and contributors.: Answer questions on forums, mailing lists, or Slack channels.
Helping others understand and use etcd is a valuable contribution.: Start by joining the etcd community on Slack,
attending SIG meetings, and following the mailing lists. This will
help you get familiar with the project, its processes, and the
people involved.: If you're new to open source or etcd, consider
finding a mentor who can guide you and provide support. Stay tuned!
Our first cohort of mentorship program was very successful. We will
have a new round of mentorship program coming up.: Don't be afraid to start with small contributions. Even
fixing a typo in the documentation or submitting a simple bug fix
can be a great way to get involved.By contributing to etcd, you'll not only be helping to improve a
critical piece of the cloud-native ecosystem but also gaining valuable
experience and skills. So, jump in and start contributing!Frederico: Excellent, thank you. Lastly, one piece of advice that
you'd like to give to other newly formed SIGs?: Absolutely! My advice would be to embrace the established
processes of the larger community, prioritize collaboration with other
SIGs, and focus on building a strong community.: Here are some tips I myself found very helpful in my OSS
journey:: Open source development can take time. Don't get
discouraged if your contributions aren't accepted immediately or if
you encounter challenges.: The etcd community values collaboration and
respect. Be mindful of others' opinions and work together to achieve
common goals.: Contributing to open source should be
enjoyable. Find areas that interest you and contribute in ways that
you find fulfilling.Frederico: A great way to end this spotlight, thank you all!For more information and resources, please take a look at :]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to install KSH on FreeBSD</title><link>https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-install-ksh-kornshell-on-freebsd/</link><author>Vivek Gite</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 3 Mar 2025 23:50:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.cyberciti.biz/atom/">Dev - NixCraft</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[nstalling KSH (KornShell) on FreeBSD can be done with either FreeBSD ports or the pkg command. The ports collection will download the KSH source code, compile it, and install it on the system. The pkg method is easier, and it will download a pre-compiled binary package. Hence, it is recommended for all users. KornShell (KSH) has a long history, and many older Unix systems and scripts rely on it. As a result, KSH remains relevant for maintaining and supporting legacy infrastructure. Large enterprises, especially those with established Unix-based systems, continue to use KSH for scripting and system administration tasks. Some industries where KSH is still commonly used include finance and telecommunications. While Bash has become the dominant shell in many Linux distributions, KSH still holds a significant presence in Unix-like environments, particularly in legacy systems. Therefore, installing KSH and practicing with it is worthwhile if you plan to work in such environments.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why is The World Run by Old People?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRNxsTkIy_w</link><author>Patrick Boyle</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/eRNxsTkIy_w?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Mar 2025 21:00:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw">Patrick Boyle</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Go to https://ground.news/pb to get up to 40% off unlimited access to stay fully informed.

The average American is 39 years old - which is half the age of the sitting president - Donald Trump. 
When Ronald Reagan was inaugurated at 69 years old, he became the oldest person to have ever served as president. Donald Trump and Joe Biden are even older and are now - the two oldest men to ever be inaugurated as president. 

The average ages in the House and Senate at 58 and 64, are significantly older than the average American. A word often used to describe the nation’s governing class is “gerontocracy” - meaning government based on rule by old people.

It's not just in the US either - around the world our political leaders are older than ever before.  Why has this happened?

But also being developed is a compiler named trapc "intended to be implemented as a cybersecurity compiler for C and C++ code, said developer Robin Rowe..."

 Due by the end of this year, trapc will be a free, open source compiler similar to Clang... Rowe said. TrapC has pointers that are memory-safe, addressing the memory safety issue with the two languages. With TrapC, developers write in C or C++ and compile in TrapC, for memory safety... 
Rowe presented TrapC at an ISO C meeting this week. Developers can download a TrapC whitepaper and offer Rowe feedback. According to the whitepaper, TrapC's memory management is automatic and cannot leak memory. Pointers are lifetime-managed, not garbage-collected. Also, TrapC reuses a few code safety features from C++, notably member functions, constructors, destructors, and the new keyword. 

"TrapC Memory Safe Pointers will not buffer overrun and will not segfault," Rowe told the ISO C Committee standards body meeting, according to the Register. "When C code is compiled using a TrapC compiler, all pointers become Memory Safe Pointers and are checked."
 
In short, TrapC "is a programming language forked from C, with changes to make it LangSec and Memory Safe," according to that white paper. "To accomplish that, TrapC seeks to eliminate all Undefined Behavior in the C programming language..." 

"The startup TRASEC and the non-profit Fountain Abode have a TrapC compiler in development, called trapc," the whitepaper adds, and their mission is "to enable recompiling legacy C code into executables that are safe by design and secure by default, without needing much code refactoring... The TRASEC trapc cybersecurity compiler with AI code reasoning is expected to release as free open source software sometime in 2025." 

In November the Register offered some background on the origins of TrapC...

What's Linux's marketshare on Steam? The Steam Survey numbers tell this story: 

11/24: 2.03%
12/24: 2.29%
01/25: 2.06%
02:25: 1.45% 

"The February numbers show a staggering 0.61% drop to Linux use..." reports Phoronix. But they attribute this to an sampling error:
According to the survey, it shows 50% of Steam users using the Simplified Chinese language pack [a 20% increase from the month before]. In prior months where there has been drops to Linux use, it's been correlated to wild swings in the Chinese use on Steam. This looks to be another such month. 
Of the Linux specific data, SteamOS continues to prove most popular for that Valve distribution powering the Steam Deck [at 34.67%, with Arch Linux coming in second at 9.7%]. 
AMD CPUs power around 70% of the Linux gaming systems thanks to the Steam Deck APU and AMD Ryzen being quite popular with Linux enthusiasts.

Though the package has been removed from PyPI, researchers at security platform Socket.dev say it enabled "coordinated, unauthorized music downloads from Deezer — a popular streaming service founded in France in 2007."

Although automslc, which has been downloaded over 100,000 times, purports to offer music automation and metadata retrieval, it covertly bypasses Deezer's access restrictions... The package is designed to log into Deezer, harvest track metadata, request full-length streaming URLs, and download complete audio files in clear violation of Deezer's API terms... [I]t orchestrates a distributed piracy operation by leveraging both user-supplied and hardcoded Deezer credentials to create sessions with Deezer's API. This approach enables full access to track metadata and the decryption tokens required to generate full-length track URLs. 

Additionally, the package routinely communicates with a remote server... to update download statuses and submit metadata, thereby centralizing control and allowing the threat actor to monitor and coordinate the distributed downloading operation. In doing so, automslc exposes critical track details — including Deezer IDs, International Standard Recording Codes, track titles, and internal tokens like MD5_ORIGIN (a hash used in generating decryption URLs) — which, when collected en masse, can be used to reassemble full track URLs and facilitate unauthorized downloads... 

Even if a user pays for access to the service, the content is licensed, not owned. The automslc package circumvents licensing restrictions by enabling downloads and potential redistribution, which is outside the bounds of fair use...

This is achieved through public key addressing and a multi-layered encryption and routing process that ensures no single node in the Tor network has complete knowledge of the communication path. Unlike traditional network addressing, where a domain name resolves to an IP address via DNS, hidden services derive self-authenticating .onion addresses from cryptographic public keys. This eliminates the need for a centralized registry, instead relying on a fully distributed lookup mechanism via a subset of Tor relays known as Hidden Service Directories (HSDirs).In this post, we explore how enables decentralized, anonymous routing and service discovery while mitigating surveillance and censorship.Addressing, Public Key Infrastructure, and Cryptographic IdentityEach hidden service is uniquely identified by its .onion address, which is directly derived from an Ed25519 public key. The service generates a key pair, where the private key remains confidential and is used to sign service descriptors, while the public key forms the basis of the address. The address itself is constructed by computing the Blake2b cryptographic hash of the public key, appending a checksum, encoding the result using Base32, and appending the .onion suffix. This deterministic derivation ensures that the .onion address is self-authenticating—clients can verify they are communicating with the correct service without relying on a trusted third party.# 1. Generate Ed25519 Key PairPrivate Key:  3f2a4b18d5e8a13c799b521d...Public Key:   af3d2e4c5b6a7890c123d456e...# 2. Compute Blake2b HashBlake2b(public_key) = d2c6e5f9a34b21d7f4c9823e...# 3. Compute Checksumchecksum = Blake2b(".onion checksum" || public_key || 0x03) = 8f2c918b6d7a...# 4. Construct Onion Addressonion_address_raw = public_key || checksum || 0x03onion_address = Base32(onion_address_raw) + ".onion"This cryptographic model ensures that only the entity possessing the corresponding private key can operate a given .onion address. It also means that services cannot arbitrarily select easy-to-remember addresses; instead, addresses are pseudo-random, unless techniques such as brute-force key generation (vanity address generation) are used.Hidden Service Descriptor and the Decentralized Lookup MechanismBecause .onion addresses do not resolve via DNS, Tor employs a decentralized lookup mechanism using Hidden Service Directories (HSDirs). The hidden service generates a , a structured document containing:Ed25519 Public Key: af3d2e4c5b6a7890c123d456e...Introduction Points: [node1, node2, node3]Signature: Signed(service_descriptor, private_key)Encrypted Metadata: Session keys, authentication infoThese descriptors are deterministically mapped to HSDir nodes based on a hash of the service’s public key. HSDirs store descriptors temporarily, typically expiring within an hour, requiring hidden services to refresh them periodically to maintain reachability. A client looking to access a service calculates the appropriate HSDirs by hashing the .onion address and querying the network for the latest descriptor. Blake2b(public_key) -> hsdir_index.The Distributed Hash Table (DHT) and Service Descriptor StorageTor’s hidden service discovery mechanism operates over a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) model, where descriptors are stored across a subset of nodes designated as HSDirs. The allocation of storage responsibilities is determined by a deterministic hash function, ensuring redundancy and fault tolerance. As time progresses, descriptor responsibility shifts dynamically among different relays. The ephemeral nature of descriptors and their encrypted structure makes large-scale enumeration of hidden services infeasible.When a client queries an HSDir for a descriptor, the request itself is onion-routed, ensuring that the HSDir does not learn the client’s IP address. To mitigate exploitation, Tor employs proof-of-work mechanisms and rate-limiting to prevent large-scale descriptor harvesting.Entry Guards and Circuit EstablishmentWhen a client or a hidden service establishes a connection to the Tor network, the first relay in its circuit is known as an entry guard. This relay is selected for its long-term stability and performance characteristics. Entry guards mitigate certain traffic correlation attacks by limiting exposure to malicious relays, as a client does not randomly select a new first-hop node for every connection.For clients, entry guards prevent frequent exposure to new first-hop nodes, which mitigates attacks where adversaries could rotate relays to observe multiple connections and correlate user activity.For hidden services, entry guards ensure a consistent first-hop into the Tor network. A hidden service forms circuits through introduction points and rendezvous points, but its entry guard remains stable over time, preventing attackers from easily mapping its presence.Since entry guards know the client’s real IP (or the hidden service’s real IP in a single-hop mode), their security and integrity are critical. However, because they do not know the final destination or whether the connection belongs to a hidden service, they cannot deanonymize users in a standard multi-hop configuration.Establishing a Connection: Introduction Points and Rendezvous PointsOnce the client retrieves the service descriptor, it selects an introduction point from the list contained in the descriptor. Introduction points are Tor relays preselected by the hidden service, maintaining persistent circuits to the service, enabling communication without exposing its actual network location.The client encrypts an introduction request using the service’s public key, ensuring that only the intended recipient can decrypt it. This request is relayed through the Tor network to the introduction point, which forwards it through its pre-established circuit to the hidden service. The service then responds by establishing a connection to a , a random Tor relay chosen by the client. Once both the client and the service connect to this relay, a bidirectional communication channel is established over separate Tor circuits, ensuring that no single entity in the network has knowledge of both endpoints.Proof-of-Work Defense Mechanism for Hidden ServicesTor’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) defense mechanism , introduced with the release of Tor 0.4.8 in August 2023, requires clients to solve computational puzzles before accessing onion services, aiming to deter Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. When an onion service detects stress, it embeds PoW parameters in its service descriptor, specifying a cryptographic challenge. The client fetches this descriptor, extracts parameters, and computes a solution using the Equi-X PoW scheme, which involves a memory-hard computational puzzle requiring RAM for efficient solving. The challenge consists of concatenated values, including a service-specific seed and nonce, hashed using the HashX function. Clients iteratively attempt solutions until they find one that meets the difficulty requirement (based on leading zero bits in a Blake2b-derived hash). The solved puzzle, nonce, and effort value are then submitted in an INTRODUCE1 message. The service verifies the solution by quickly checking its hash and the Equi-X proof, then places the request in a priority queue based on effort. Clients investing more computational work receive higher priority in the queue, ensuring that motivated users bypass attackers attempting to flood introduction requests. Dynamic difficulty tuning ensures adaptive effort adjustments based on observed attack severity, keeping the service available while discouraging large-scale automated abuse.Routing, Onion Encryption, and Traffic FlowTor’s circuit-based routing model ensures that no single node in the network possesses a complete view of a communication path. Onion encryption encapsulates messages in multiple layers, where each relay decrypts only its layer, revealing the next hop without exposing the full route.Decrypts a single encryption layer to determine the next relayForwards the partially decrypted packet without knowledge of its ultimate destinationAdds an additional layer of encryption when transmitting responses back to the clientBy the time traffic reaches the rendezvous point, both the client and the hidden service are communicating through independent Tor circuits, preventing correlation of the origin and destination.Non-Anonymous Single-Hop Hidden ServicesTor supports an alternative mode for hidden services that prioritizes performance over anonymity. By enabling HiddenServiceNonAnonymousMode 1 and HiddenServiceSingleHopMode 1, a hidden service bypasses the traditional three-hop circuit model and instead directly registers with HSDirs while accepting connections through a single-hop Tor circuit.While this significantly reduces latency, it exposes the service’s real IP address to its entry guard relay, making it traceable. This configuration is primarily used for services requiring censorship resistance but not anonymity, such as certain high-performance Tor-based applications or relays used for onion-routed content distribution.Service Availability and Scalability ConsiderationsReliability of hidden services is affected by factors including descriptor refresh rates, introduction point stability, and HSDir churn. A hidden service can improve availability by increasing the number of introduction points, ensuring resilience against relay failures. However, since the descriptor itself is the bottleneck for discovery, additional introduction points do not necessarily accelerate lookup speed. Services must ensure they remain online consistently to prevent descriptor expiration, as clients will otherwise be unable to retrieve valid routing information.To mitigate excessive load, Tor imposes limits on the number of introduction points per service. High-traffic services often deploy load-balancing mechanisms by distributing traffic across multiple onion addresses, each backed by different backend nodes. This approach prevents bottlenecks in descriptor resolution and introduction request handling.Security and Resistance to EnumerationTor’s architectural design makes hidden services resistant to large-scale enumeration and targeted de-anonymization attacks. The use of DHT-based lookup combined with ephemeral descriptors, encryption, and circuit-layer separation ensures that no single entity in the network can trivially index all hidden services. Additionally:HSDir nodes can only observe encrypted descriptors, not .onion addresses directlyIntroduction points never learn the client’s IP addressRendezvous points see only anonymized Tor circuits, preventing correlationThe self-authenticating nature of .onion addresses ensures that man-in-the-middle attacks are infeasible. Even if an attacker compromises an HSDir node, they cannot alter or forge descriptors without detection due to cryptographic signing.Decentralized Communication with Tor Hidden ServicesTor hidden services provide a censorship-resistant, decentralized alternative to traditional domain-based addressing. Unlike conventional services that rely on DNS and public IP exposure, .onion addresses are self-authenticating and do not require a central registry, making them resilient against domain seizures and network filtering.A key advantage of hidden services is their ability to function within NAT-restricted environments and firewalled networks. Unlike traditional services that rely on port forwarding, hidden services establish outbound-only Tor circuits, allowing them to function seamlessly behind NAT, carrier-grade NAT (CGNAT), and firewalls without requiring manually opened inbound ports. The service initiates outgoing circuits to introduction points, meaning that as long as the service has an outbound connection, it remains accessible — even in networks that typically block unsolicited inbound connections. This makes .onion services ideal for hosting within home networks, mobile carriers, and restricted corporate environments where traditional hosting would be infeasible without port forwarding or VPN tunneling.Multi-hop circuits remain the foundation of anonymous hidden services, while single-hop configurations offer a higher performance alternative at the cost of privacy. Despite this trade-off, .onion addressing continues to provide decentralized resolution, censorship resistance, and NAT-friendly deployment, making it viable for both anonymity-preserving and infrastructure-agnostic use cases.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Boats and Planes Are Also Going Electric</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeYySXlo8js</link><author>ColdFusion</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/zeYySXlo8js?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 2 Mar 2025 04:58:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4QZ_LsYcvcq7qOsOhpAX4A">ColdFusion</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Join me at Everything Electric 2025.

They'd spotted a Reddit post "detailing how someone took a 27-year-old visual basic EXE file, fed it to Claude 3.7, and watched as it reverse-engineered the program and rewrote it in Python."

It was an old Visual Basic 4 program they had written in 1997. Running a VB4 exe in 2024 can be a real yak-shaving compatibility nightmare, chasing down outdated DLLs and messy workarounds. So! OP decided to upload the exe to Claude 3.7 with this request: 
"Can you tell me how to get this file running? It'd be nice to convert it to Python."> 
Claude 3.7 analyzed the binary, extracted the VB 'tokens' (VB is not a fully-machine-code-compiled language which makes this task a lot easier than something from C/C++), identified UI elements, and even extracted sound files. Then, it generated a complete Python equivalent using Pygame. According to the author, the code worked on the first try and the entire process took less than five minutes... 
Torrone speculates on what this might mean. "Old business applications and games could be modernized without needing the original source code... Tools like Claude might make decompilation and software archaeology a lot easier: proprietary binaries from dead platforms could get a new life in open-source too." 

And maybe Archive.org could even add an LLM "to do this on the fly!"]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Egypt Detectives: Ancient Egyptian Mysteries Uncovered</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcdpsRucdno</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/LcdpsRucdno?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 1 Mar 2025 22:00:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Join archaeologist Miriam Cooke and Egyptologist Dominic Montserrat in Egypt Detectives, a thrilling documentary series uncovering the mysteries of ancient Egypt.

This week they announced that the CPAN Security Group "was authorized by the CVE Program as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)" to assign and manage CVE vulnerability identifications for Perl and CPAN Modules. 

"This is great news!" posted Linux kernel maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman on social media, saying the announcement came "Just in time for my talk about this very topic in a few weeks about how all open source projects should be doing this" at the Linux Foundation Member Summit in Napa, California. And Curl creator Daniel Stenberg posted "I'm with Greg Kroah-Hartman on this: all Open Source projects should become CNAs. Or team up with others to do it." (Also posting "Agreed" to the suggestion was Seth Larson, the Python Software Foundation's security developer-in-residence involved in their successful effort to become a CNA in 2023.) 

444 CNAs have now partnered with the CVE Program, according to their official web site. The announcement from PerlMonks.org:

Years ago, a few people decided during the Perl Toolchain Summit (PTS) that it would be a good idea to join forces, ideas and knowledge and start a group to monitor vulnerabilities in the complete Perl ecosystem from core to the smallest CPAN release. The goal was to follow legislation and CVE reports, and help authors in taking actions on not being vulnerable anymore. That group has grown stable over the past years and is now known as CPANSec. 

The group has several focus areas, and one of them is channeling CVE vulnerability issues. In that specific goal, a milestone has been reached: CPANSec has just been authorized as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) for Perl and modules on CPAN

You’ll find references at the bottom of this page if you want to go deeper.Once upon a time, there lived a student named Jonas.Although extremely bright, he struggled with chemistry lessons. And spent countless hours doing homework.So he was sad and frustrated.Until one day, he decides to ask for help with homework from his friend, Emma.And shares a Google Document with her.The changes have to be visible in real-time to both of them, which means a bidirectional communication pattern is necessary.Let’s quickly look into potential communication patterns to handle this use case:The client requests the server for an update, and the server responds after processing it. Although this approach is simple and efficient, the client has to request the server again for an update. So it isn’t real-time.Imagine  as automatically refreshing the browser every few seconds to check a stock’s price.The client  asks the server for an update, while the server returns an empty response if nothing has changed. It can track changes in real time.Yet there are some problems with this approach:Responsiveness depends on the interval between requests.Extra overhead from connection requests and empty responses.So it’s inefficient for this use case.Think of  as asking a restaurant waiter for food, and then waiting at the counter until it's ready.The client requests, and the server responds only when there’s an update. Put simply, the server doesn’t send an empty response; instead, it  the request and waits for an update to occur. Yet the server sends an empty response on timeout. And client has to make an extra request to receive every change.Although it allows real-time communication, there are some problems with this approach:The server has to maintain many open connections, and it consumes resources.The client has to make a separate request for sending data to the server.So it’s inefficient for this use case.Think of  like a radio broadcast, it's one way and listeners can't talk back to the radio station.The client requests the server, and it creates an open connection with the client.The server then updates the client whenever anything changes. Yet the communication is , and the client has to make a separate request to send data to the server.So it's inefficient for this use case.Meet Trae, an adaptive AI IDE that transforms how you work, collaborating with you to run faster:Simply describe your project needs in natural language, and watch it built by Trae.Upload your design files and let Trae assist in translating your visual concepts into clean, workable code.As you code, Trae learns your project patterns and provides contextually relevant suggestions to help you code more efficiently.Google Docs use websockets for bidirectional communication in real-time.Imagine  as a telephone call, both people can talk at the same time.1. Opening a Websocket ConnectionThe technique of opening a websockets connection is called the .The client sends an HTTP GET request to the server asking for a websocket connection.The HTTP request includes specific headers.The handshake is complete and opens a Transmission Control Protocol () connection for bidirectional communication.The client and server can exchange data in both directions in real-time. It supports text and binary data formats.2. Transferring Data Through WebsocketsA websocket message can be split into frames for performance. A frame contains information such as payload data in binary syntax. A frame allows the sender to have only a small buffer to keep data. The receiver then assembles the frames to reconstruct the original websocket message.3. Closing a Websocket ConnectionThe technique of closing a websocket connection is called .The client or server can close the connection. A websocket frame with a specific code is used to signal the close. The connection is closed after the receiver acknowledges it.The server then deallocates the resources.I wrote a summary of this post (save it for later):And I’d love to connect if you’re on Twitter:Websocket is efficient because it can send updates through a single connection.Yet it needs a persistent and stateful connection between the client and server. While a server can handle only limited websocket connections because of memory and socket limitations.Although good for specific use cases, it isn’t a silver bullet for real-time communication.👋 PS - Do you want to level up at work?I’m launching system design deep dives in March 2025.But it’ll be available only to paid subscribers of this newsletter.My mission is to help you go from 0 to 1 in system design by spending less than an hour each month.

in Kubernetes 1.29. Currently in beta, it is expected to be GA as of
1.33. The new mode fixes long-standing performance problems with the
iptables mode and all users running on systems with reasonably-recent
kernels are encouraged to try it out. (For compatibility reasons, even
once nftables becomes GA, iptables will still be the .)Why nftables? Part 1: data plane latencyThe iptables API was designed for implementing simple firewalls, and
has problems scaling up to support Service proxying in a large
Kubernetes cluster with tens of thousands of Services.In general, the ruleset generated by kube-proxy in iptables mode has a
number of iptables rules proportional to the sum of the number of
Services and the total number of endpoints. In particular, at the top
level of the ruleset, there is one rule to test each possible Service
IP (and port) that a packet might be addressed to:# If the packet is addressed to 172.30.0.41:80, then jump to the chain
# KUBE-SVC-XPGD46QRK7WJZT7O for further processing
-A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment --comment "namespace1/service1:p80 cluster IP" -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.41 --dport 80 -j KUBE-SVC-XPGD46QRK7WJZT7O
# If the packet is addressed to 172.30.0.42:443, then...
-A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment --comment "namespace2/service2:p443 cluster IP" -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.42 --dport 443 -j KUBE-SVC-GNZBNJ2PO5MGZ6GT
# etc...
-A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment --comment "namespace3/service3:p80 cluster IP" -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.43 --dport 80 -j KUBE-SVC-X27LE4BHSL4DOUIK
This means that when a packet comes in, the time it takes the kernel
to check it against all of the Service rules is  in the number
of Services. As the number of Services increases, both the average and
the worst-case latency for the first packet of a new connection
increases (with the difference between best-case, average, and
worst-case being mostly determined by whether a given Service IP
address appears earlier or later in the  chain).By contrast, with nftables, the normal way to write a ruleset like
this is to have a  rule, using a "verdict map" to do the
dispatch:table ip kube-proxy {
# The service-ips verdict map indicates the action to take for each matching packet.
map service-ips {
type ipv4_addr . inet_proto . inet_service : verdict
comment "ClusterIP, ExternalIP and LoadBalancer IP traffic"
elements = { 172.30.0.41 . tcp . 80 : goto service-ULMVA6XW-namespace1/service1/tcp/p80,
172.30.0.42 . tcp . 443 : goto service-42NFTM6N-namespace2/service2/tcp/p443,
172.30.0.43 . tcp . 80 : goto service-4AT6LBPK-namespace3/service3/tcp/p80,
... }
}
# Now we just need a single rule to process all packets matching an
# element in the map. (This rule says, "construct a tuple from the
# destination IP address, layer 4 protocol, and destination port; look
# that tuple up in "service-ips"; and if there's a match, execute the
# associated verdict.)
chain services {
ip daddr . meta l4proto . th dport vmap @service-ips
}
...
}
Since there's only a single rule, with a roughly  map lookup,
packet processing time is more or less constant regardless of cluster
size, and the best/average/worst cases are very similar:But note the huge difference in the vertical scale between the
iptables and nftables graphs! In the clusters with 5000 and 10,000
Services, the p50 (average) latency for nftables is about the same as
the p01 (approximately best-case) latency for iptables. In the 30,000
Service cluster, the p99 (approximately worst-case) latency for
nftables manages to beat out the p01 latency for iptables by a few
microseconds! Here's both sets of data together, but you may have to
squint to see the nftables results!:Why nftables? Part 2: control plane latencyWhile the improvements to data plane latency in large clusters are
great, there's another problem with iptables kube-proxy that often
keeps users from even being able to grow their clusters to that size:
the time it takes kube-proxy to program new iptables rules when
Services and their endpoints change.With both iptables and nftables, the total size of the ruleset as a
whole (actual rules, plus associated data) is  in the combined
number of Services and their endpoints. Originally, the iptables
backend would rewrite every rule on every update, and with tens of
thousands of Services, this could grow to be hundreds of thousands of
iptables rules. Starting in Kubernetes 1.26, we began improving
kube-proxy so that it could skip updating  of the unchanged
rules in each update, but the limitations of  as an
API meant that it was still always necessary to send an update that's
 in the number of Services (though with a noticeably smaller
constant than it used to be). Even with those optimizations, it can
still be necessary to make use of kube-proxy's  config
option to ensure that it doesn't spend every waking second trying to
push iptables updates.The nftables APIs allow for doing much more incremental updates, and
when kube-proxy in nftables mode does an update, the size of the
update is only  in the number of Services and endpoints that
have changed since the last sync, regardless of the total number of
Services and endpoints. The fact that the nftables API allows each
nftables-using component to have its own private table also means that
there is no global lock contention between components like with
iptables. As a result, kube-proxy's nftables updates can be done much
more efficiently than with iptables.(Unfortunately I don't have cool graphs for this part.)All that said, there are a few reasons why you might not want to jump
right into using the nftables backend for now.First, the code is still fairly new. While it has plenty of unit
tests, performs correctly in our CI system, and has now been used in
the real world by multiple users, it has not seen anything close to as
much real-world usage as the iptables backend has, so we can't promise
that it is as stable and bug-free.Second, the nftables mode will not work on older Linux distributions;
currently it requires a 5.13 or newer kernel. Additionally, because of
bugs in early versions of the  command line tool, you should not
run kube-proxy in nftables mode on nodes that have an old (earlier
than 1.0.0) version of  in the host filesystem (or else
kube-proxy's use of nftables may interfere with other uses of nftables
on the system).Third, you may have other networking components in your cluster, such
as the pod network or NetworkPolicy implementation, that do not yet
support kube-proxy in nftables mode. You should consult the
documentation (or forums, bug tracker, etc.) for any such components
to see if they have problems with nftables mode. (In many cases they
will not; as long as they don't try to directly interact with or
override kube-proxy's iptables rules, they shouldn't care whether
kube-proxy is using iptables or nftables.) Additionally, observability
and monitoring tools that have not been updated may report less data
for kube-proxy in nftables mode than they do for kube-proxy in
iptables mode.Finally, kube-proxy in nftables mode is intentionally not 100%
compatible with kube-proxy in iptables mode. There are a few old
kube-proxy features whose default behaviors are less secure, less
performant, or less intuitive than we'd like, but where we felt that
changing the default would be a compatibility break. Since the
nftables mode is opt-in, this gave us a chance to fix those bad
defaults without breaking users who weren't expecting changes. (In
particular, with nftables mode, NodePort Services are now only
reachable on their nodes' default IPs, as opposed to being reachable
on all IPs, including , with iptables mode.) The
kube-proxy documentation has more information about this, including
information about metrics you can look at to determine if you are
relying on any of the changed functionality, and what configuration
options are available to get more backward-compatible behavior.Ready to try it out? In Kubernetes 1.31 and later, you just need to
pass  to kube-proxy (or set  in
your kube-proxy config file).You can also convert existing clusters from iptables (or ipvs) mode to
nftables by updating the kube-proxy configuration and restarting the
kube-proxy pods. (You do not need to reboot the nodes: when restarting
in nftables mode, kube-proxy will delete any existing iptables or ipvs
rules, and likewise, if you later revert back to iptables or ipvs
mode, it will delete any existing nftables rules.)As mentioned above, while nftables is now the  kube-proxy mode,
it is not the , and we do not yet have a plan for changing
that. We will continue to support the iptables mode for a long time.The future of the IPVS mode of kube-proxy is less certain: its main
advantage over iptables was that it was faster, but certain aspects of
the IPVS architecture and APIs were awkward for kube-proxy's purposes
(for example, the fact that the  device needs to have
 Service IP address assigned to it), and some parts of
Kubernetes Service proxying semantics were difficult to implement
using IPVS (particularly the fact that some Services had to have
different endpoints depending on whether you connected to them from a
local or remote client). And now, the nftables mode has the same
performance as IPVS mode (actually, slightly better), without any of
the downsides:(In theory the IPVS mode also has the advantage of being able to use
various other IPVS functionality, like alternative "schedulers" for
balancing endpoints. In practice, this ended up not being very useful,
because kube-proxy runs independently on every node, and the IPVS
schedulers on each node had no way of sharing their state with the
proxies on other nodes, thus thwarting the effort to balance traffic
more cleverly.)While the Kubernetes project does not have an immediate plan to drop
the IPVS backend, it is probably doomed in the long run, and people
who are currently using IPVS mode should try out the nftables mode
instead (and file bugs if you think there is missing functionality in
nftables mode that you can't work around).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mass Roman Baby Grave: The Real Roman Britain Revealed?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01dKYQqXI2o</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/01dKYQqXI2o?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 22:00:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A mass infant grave?

Finally, we'll take a deep dive into  like how to efficiently find nearby drivers.Before diving into the design, lets outline the functional and non-functional requirements.Riders should be able to input their pickup and destination locations and request a ride.The system should provide an estimated time of arrival (ETA) and estimated fare to riders before they confirm the booking.The system should match riders with available drivers who are in close proximity.: Drivers should be able to accept or decline incoming ride requests.: Once a rider is matched with a driver, the rider should be able to track the driver’s location and view the estimated time of arrival (ETA).: Both riders and drivers should have the ability to rate each other after a ride is completed.: The user should be able to complete the payment after the ride is completed.Non-Functional Requirements:: The system should provide real-time location updates and fast driver-rider matching.: The system should be up 24/7 with minimal downtime.: The system must handle peak loads (e.g., New Year’s Eve, sporting events).50 million riders, 5 million driversDaily Active Users (DAU): 10 million riders, 1 million drivers: 1 million riders,  ~100,000 drivers (assuming 10% of DAUs are active at peak hours)Average Daily Ride Requests: 10 million globallyPeak rides per second (RPS): ~5,000A driver sends a location update  while active.Assuming  at peak time:Location updates per second: 100,000 / 3 ≈ 33,333 updates/sec: ~2 KB per user (name, email, phone, payment method, preferences): ~5 KB per driver (vehicle details, license, payment details, ratings)Total storage for 50M users: (50M × 2 KB) + (5M × 5 KB) = (Ride ID (UUID) → 16 bytesRider ID, Driver ID → 8 bytes eachStart & end location (lat/lon) → 16 bytesFare, pickup/dropoff time → 24 bytes ~80 bytes 10M × 80 Bytes = Storage per year (365 days):Network Bandwidth EstimationEach API call (ride request, driver update, fare estimation, etc.) contributes to network usage.: ~5,000 RPSDriver location updates per second: ~33,333 RPS: ~40,000 RPSAssuming an  of , network bandwidth usage at peak:40,000 RPS × 5 KB = 200 MB/sec]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Black May 1943 was DEVASTATING for German U-Boats</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZAIrWFO-40</link><author>Imperial War Museums</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/mZAIrWFO-40?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 12:01:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3uAjWoLZ4bSi6qI9SjALxA">Imperial War Museums</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[#ww2 #history #battleoftheatlantic #iwm #uboat]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Browser Security with Jeswin Mathai</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/02/27/browser-security-with-jeswin-mathai/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=browser-security-with-jeswin-mathai</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED2491544065.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 10:00:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Browser security aims to protect users from cyber threats encountered online, such as phishing, malicious extensions, and malware.

And at what cost? Our world is shaped by choices—some calculated, some reckless, most irreversible. From Kennedy and Khrushchev stepping to the brink of nuclear annihilation to Putin’s recent invasion of Ukraine, leaders have made decisions that have altered the course of humanity. Never was this more true than in the Second World War—the deadliest conflict in human history. WWII transformed the world, reducing ancient cities to rubble, displacing millions, and ushering in the atomic age. At the centre stood six men: Adolf Hitler, Winston Churchill, Benito Mussolini, Joseph Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Emperor Hirohito. Their decisions—some brilliant, others catastrophic—reshaped nations and decided the fate of millions.In this gripping mini-series, Dan steps inside the war room and breaks down the key strategic moves made by these infamous leaders, with the help of Phillips O’Brien (esteemed professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews).

Lost Records is a game that revels in the melodrama and contradictory nature of adolescence. It understands the yearning we all once had to be completely unknowable and one-of-a-kind while also being fully-understood, accepted, and loved. Within its eight or so hours, insecurity and conviction walk hand-in-hand while the assumed invincibility of youth is stretched to its breaking point. How can one summer--how can --feel so everlasting yet utterly fragile? Such is the magic of our teenage years.Lost Records captures this phenomenon stunningly, yet doesn't settle for being a game merely driven entirely by nostalgia or reminders of what it felt like to be young in the '90s. At its core is an eerie, supernatural mystery that spans nearly three decades and threatens to consume the four women involved in it--one that promises violence and the reemergence of events perhaps better left forgotten. This intense, slow-burning narrative provides an excellent framework for an empathetic exploration into girlhood, friendship, sexuality, individuality, expression, and the transition from youth to middle age. All this combined with dynamic characters, cinematic visuals, beautifully-rendered character models, and keen sense of atmosphere makes Lost Records one of Don't Nod's best games to date.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mary, Queen of Scots</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/queen-of-scots-mary</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/67bc86d019249d0c1a6d8f00/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=GtxOZiLfcAbHNEsURMPrACCd_6JUDRhfgf4gUf5H13Q" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is the story of the incredible rise and fall of Mary, Queen of Scots.

      Michael Pratt
      26 February 2025
      The hash table is a central data structure in computer science, and it provides the implementation for the map type in many languages, including Go.The concept of a hash table was first described by Hans Peter Luhn in 1953 in an internal IBM memo that suggested speeding up search by placing items into “buckets” and using a linked list for overflow when buckets already contain an item.
Today we would call this a hash table using chaining.With data structures that have been around this long, it’s easy to think that they must be “done”; that we know everything there is to know about them and they can’t be improved anymore.
That’s not true!
Computer science research continues to make advancements in fundamental algorithms, both in terms of algorithmic complexity and taking advantage of modern CPU hardware.
For example, Go 1.19 switched the  package from a traditional quicksort, to pattern-defeating quicksort, a novel sorting algorithm from Orson R. L. Peters, first described in 2015.Go 1.24 includes a completely new implementation of the built-in map type, based on the Swiss Table design.
In this blog post we’ll look at how Swiss Tables improve upon traditional hash tables, and at some of the unique challenges in bringing the Swiss Table design to Go’s maps.Open-addressed hash tableSwiss Tables are a form of open-addressed hash table, so let’s do a quick overview of how a basic open-addressed hash table works.In an open-addressed hash table, all items are stored in a single backing array.
We’ll call each location in the array a .
The slot to which a key belongs is primarily determined by the , .
The hash function maps each key to an integer, where the same key always maps to the same integer, and different keys ideally follow a uniform random distribution of integers.
The defining feature of open-addressed hash tables is that they resolve collisions by storing the key elsewhere in the backing array.
So, if the slot is already full (a ), then a  is used to consider other slots until an empty slot is found.
Let’s take a look at a sample hash table to see how this works.Below you can see a 16-slot backing array for a hash table, and the key (if any) stored in each slot.
The values are not shown, as they are not relevant to this example.To insert a new key, we use the hash function to select a slot.
Since there are only 16 slots, we need to restrict to this range, so we’ll use  as the target slot.
Suppose we want to insert key  and .
Slot 7 is empty, so we simply insert 98 there.
On the other hand, suppose we want to insert key  and .
Slot 3 is a collision because it already contains key 56.
Thus we cannot insert here.We use a probe sequence to find another slot.
There are a variety of well-known probe sequences.
The original and most straightforward probe sequence is , which simply tries successive slots in order.So, in the  example, since slot 3 is in use, we would consider slot 4 next, which is also in use.
So too is slot 5.
Finally, we’d get to empty slot 6, where we’d store key 25.Lookup follows the same approach.
A lookup of key 25 would start at slot 3, check whether it contains key 25 (it does not), and then continue linear probing until it finds key 25 in slot 6.This example uses a backing array with 16 slots.
What happens if we insert more than 16 elements?
If the hash table runs out of space, it will grow, usually by doubling the size of the backing array.
All existing entries are reinserted into the new backing array.Open-addressed hash tables don’t actually wait until the backing array is completely full to grow because as the array gets more full, the average length of each probe sequence increases.
In the example above using key 25, we must probe 4 different slots to find an empty slot.
If the array had only one empty slot, the worst case probe length would be O(n).
That is, you may need to scan the entire array.
The proportion of used slots is called the , and most hash tables define a  (typically 70-90%) at which point they will grow to avoid the extremely long probe sequences of very full hash tables.The Swiss Table design is also a form of open-addressed hash table.
Let’s see how it improves over a traditional open-addressed hash table.
We still have a single backing array for storage, but we will break the array into logical  of 8 slots each.
(Larger group sizes are possible as well. More on that below.)In addition, each group has a 64-bit  for metadata.
Each of the 8 bytes in the control word corresponds to one of the slots in the group.
The value of each byte denotes whether that slot is empty, deleted, or in use.
If it is in use, the byte contains the lower 7 bits of the hash for that slot’s key (called ).Insertion works as follows:Compute  and break the hash into two parts: the upper 57-bits (called ) and the lower 7 bits (called ).The upper bits () are used to select the first group to consider:  in this case, as there are only 2 groups.Within a group, all slots are equally eligible to hold the key. We must first determine whether any slot already contains this key, in which case this is an update rather than a new insertion.If no slot contains the key, then we look for an empty slot to place this keyIf no slot is empty, then we continue the probe sequence by searching the next group.Lookup follows the same basic process.
If we find an empty slot in step 4, then we know an insertion would have used this slot and can stop the search.Step 3 is where the Swiss Table magic happens.
We need to check whether any slot in a group contains the desired key.
Naively, we could just do a linear scan and compare all 8 keys.
However, the control word lets us do this more efficiently.
Each byte contains the lower 7 bits of the hash () for that slot.
If we determine which bytes of the control word contain the  we are looking for, we’ll have a set of candidate matches.In other words, we want to do a byte-by-byte equality comparison within the control word.
For example, if we are looking for key 32, where , the operation we want looks like so.This is an operation supported by SIMD hardware, where a single instruction performs parallel operations on independent values within a larger value (). In this case, we can implement this operation using a set of standard arithmetic and bitwise operations when special SIMD hardware is not available.The result is a set of candidate slots.
Slots where  does not match do not have a matching key, so they can be skipped.
Slots where  does match are potential matches, but we must still check the entire key, as there is potential for collisions (1/128 probability of collision with a 7-bit hash, so still quite low).This operation is very powerful, as we have effectively performed 8 steps of a probe sequence at once, in parallel.
This speeds up lookup and insertion by reducing the average number of comparisons we need to perform.
This improvement to probing behavior allowed both the Abseil and Go implementations to increase the maximum load factor of Swiss Table maps compared to prior maps, which lowers the average memory footprint.Go’s built-in map type has some unusual properties that pose additional challenges to adopting a new map design.
Two were particularly tricky to deal with.When a hash table reaches its maximum load factor, it needs to grow the backing array.
Typically this means the next insertion doubles the size of the array, and copies all entries to the new array.
Imagine inserting into a map with 1GB of entries.
Most insertions are very fast, but the one insertion that needs to grow the map from 1GB to 2GB will need to copy 1GB of entries, which will take a long time.Go is frequently used for latency-sensitive servers, so we don’t want operations on built-in types that can have arbitrarily large impact on tail latency.
Instead, Go maps grow incrementally, so that each insertion has an upper bound on the amount of growth work it must do.
This bounds the latency impact of a single map insertion.Unfortunately, the Abseil (C++) Swiss Table design assumes all at once growth, and the probe sequence depends on the total group count, making it difficult to break up.Go’s built-in map addresses this with another layer of indirection by splitting each map into multiple Swiss Tables.
Rather than a single Swiss Table implementing the entire map, each map consists of one or more independent tables that cover a subset of the key space.
An individual table stores a maximum of 1024 entries.
A variable number of upper bits in the hash are used to select which table a key belongs to.
This is a form of , where the number of bits used increases as needed to differentiate the total number of tables.During insertion, if an individual table needs to grow, it will do so all at once, but other tables are unaffected.
Thus the upper bound for a single insertion is the latency of growing a 1024-entry table into two 1024-entry tables, copying 1024 entries.Modification during iterationMany hash table designs, including Abseil’s Swiss Tables, forbid modifying the map during iteration.
The Go language spec explicitly allows modifications during iteration, with the following semantics:If an entry is deleted before it is reached, it will not be produced.If an entry is updated before it is reached, the updated value will be produced.If a new entry is added, it may or may not be produced.A typical approach to hash table iteration is to simply walk through the backing array and produce values in the order they are laid out in memory.
This approach runs afoul of the above semantics, most notably because insertions may grow the map, which would shuffle the memory layout.We can avoid the impact of shuffle during growth by having the iterator keep a reference to the table it is currently iterating over.
If that table grows during iteration, we keep using the old version of the table and thus continue to deliver keys in the order of the old memory layout.Does this work with the above semantics?
New entries added after growth will be missed entirely, as they are only added to the grown table, not the old table.
That’s fine, as the semantics allow new entries not to be produced.
Updates and deletions are a problem, though: using the old table could produce stale or deleted entries.This edge case is addressed by using the old table only to determine the iteration order.
Before actually returning the entry, we consult the grown table to determine whether the entry still exists, and to retrieve the latest value.This covers all the core semantics, though there are even more small edge cases not covered here.
Ultimately, the permissiveness of Go maps with iteration results in iteration being the most complex part of Go’s map implementation.In microbenchmarks, map operations are up to 60% faster than in Go 1.23.
Exact performance improvement varies quite a bit due to the wide variety of operations and uses of maps, and some edge cases do regress compared to Go 1.23.
Overall, in full application benchmarks, we found a geometric mean CPU time improvement of around 1.5%.There are more map improvements we want to investigate for future Go releases.
For example, we may be able to increase the locality of operations on maps that are not in the CPU cache.We could also further improve the control word comparisons.
As described above, we have a portable implementation using standard arithmetic and bitwise operations.
However, some architectures have SIMD instructions that perform this sort of comparison directly.
Go 1.24 already uses 8-byte SIMD instructions for amd64, but we could extend support to other architectures.
More importantly, while standard instructions operate on up to 8-byte words, SIMD instructions nearly always support at least 16-byte words.
This means we could increase the group size to 16 slots, and perform 16 hash comparisons in parallel instead of 8.
This would further decrease the average number of probes required for lookups.A Swiss Table-based Go map implementation has been a long time coming, and involved many contributors.
I want to thank YunHao Zhang (@zhangyunhao116), PJ Malloy (@thepudds), and @andy-wm-arthur for building initial versions of a Go Swiss Table implementation.
Peter Mattis (@petermattis) combined these ideas with solutions to the Go challenges above to build github.com/cockroachdb/swiss, a Go-spec compliant Swiss Table implementation.
The Go 1.24 built-in map implementation is heavily based on Peter’s work.
Thank you to everyone in the community that contributed!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>1917: The Making Of A Revolution</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZZt7zVWJSI</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/IZZt7zVWJSI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 22:00:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Russian Revolution of 1917 marked the beginning of a new era, sending shockwaves across the world and overturning political thought.

--

Globally, we produce more than a trillion computer chips every year. Which means about 20 trillion transistors are built every second— and this process is done in fewer than 500 fabrication plants. How do we build so many tiny, intricately-connected devices, so incredibly fast? George Zaidan and Sajan Saini explore how photolithography helps build these devices and its environmental impact.

Most of us love animals but also eat meat. Unfortunately, most animals we eat live in truly horrible conditions. We don’t torture them for better meat, just for cheaper meat. If we all paid just a bit more, we could avoid most animal suffering – often just for a few cents per meal. What would it truly cost us to avoid animal torture and still eat meat?

These book are not tied to any specific library, tool or framework; instead, they focus on  that can be applied to any tech stack.They cover multiple aspects of building software, from coding and design patterns to distributed systems, microservices, and designing good APIs. I also found most of them very helpful when preparing for . is all about writing high-quality, maintainable code. The author, Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob), provides guidelines and best practices for structuring your code, naming variables, handling errors, and more.You’ll learn how to make your code more readable and easier to understand, not just for yourself but for any developer who might read it later. It also covers principles like the Single Responsibility Principle, DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself), and how to effectively refactor your code when it starts to get messy.How it can help your career:Writing clean code is one of the most important skills for a Software Engineer. By applying the principles in this book, you’ll be able to deliver features faster, avoid technical debt, and stand out as someone who values code quality. This can open up opportunities for leadership roles and help you perform better in coding interviews.Head First Design Patterns uses a fun, engaging style to teach you the core design patterns you’ll encounter in everyday software development. The book breaks down each pattern in a visually-rich format, making it easier to understand why and when to use them.You’ll learn how to recognize common problems in code and how to solve them using design patterns like the Strategy Pattern, Observer Pattern, Singleton Pattern, and more. This book makes heavy use of code examples and diagrams, so it’s great for visual learners.How it can help your career:Design patterns are frequently asked about in technical interviews, and they also come up a lot when you’re collaborating with other engineers. Having a solid understanding of design patterns will help you write flexible, scalable solutions and communicate better with your peers about how to structure your code.This book focuses on how to build systems that handle large amounts of data reliably, efficiently, and securely. It covers topics like data modeling, database internals, distributed systems, transactions, and scalability.You’ll gain a deep understanding of how different storage systems work (SQL, NoSQL, etc.) and how to handle big data challenges. Martin Kleppmann explains concepts like replication, partitioning, and consistency in a way that is easy to grasp, even if you’re new to distributed systems.How it can help your career:As data volumes grow in almost every company, understanding how to design data-intensive systems is a crucial skill. This knowledge is also extremely valuable in System Design Interviews, where you’re often asked about scalability, reliability, and performance. gives a detailed look at how to design and implement microservice-based systems. Sam Newman walks through the fundamentals of what microservices are, why they’re useful, and how to manage the challenges that come with them.You’ll learn about service boundaries, communication patterns (like synchronous vs. asynchronous), testing strategies for microservices, and how to deploy and monitor distributed systems. The book also covers organizational aspects—such as team structures—that can support a microservices architecture.How it can help your career:Microservices are widely adopted in modern tech companies, and many architectural interviews will delve into your understanding of them. Knowing how to break a monolith into microservices and handle issues like service discovery, API gateways, and observability can make you a stronger candidate for senior engineering roles. focuses on the practical aspects of creating robust, well-documented, and user-friendly APIs. It covers the entire process—from planning and design to documentation and versioning. It includes expert advice, worksheets, checklists, and case studies from companies including Slack, Stripe, Facebook, and GitHub.You’ll discover how to define API requirements, choose the right data formats (like JSON, XML), and handle authentication and rate-limiting.

As a horror fan, it was incredible to place myself in the middle of some iconic imagery from the series. A VR game like Alien: Rogue Incursion offers a similar promise: Immerse yourself in the world of Alien in a way no game has previously allowed--natively anyway, as Alien: Isolation does enjoy some player-made VR mods today. But Rogue Incursion can't quite capture the essence of the series for a multitude of reasons, but chief among them is a starring monster who feels suddenly toothless.Alien: Rogue Incursion is a VR-only entry in the long history of video games based on Alien. Typically, those titled Alien--singular--look to the slow-paced original for inspiration, while those prefixed with the plural, go for a more action-oriented take akin to James Cameron's sequel. That's the first oddity of Rogue Incursion. It's not necessarily beholden to this naming convention, but the game has you spraying-and-praying at so many Xenos that it feels more like an action game than the survival-horror experience you might expect.This is despite the fact that the developers clearly looked toward Alien: Isolation for inspiration, from the look of the androids--which Creative Assembly had introduced to the mythology back in 2014--to the signature movement scanner that you can now physically pull from your inventory in VR. Isolation protagonist Amanda Ripley is even name-dropped at one moment, so it seems Rogue Incursion wants to harken back to its predecessor... until it doesn't.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI killed the tech interview.

But what exactly would you learn? 

Luke Tomes follows in the footsteps of the young men on their ‘grand tour’ of Europe, an educational rite of passage, in which the art of duelling and dancing were very much central to the programme. Challenging Kate Lister to a fencing bout before taking part in a 17th century dance-off, Luke finds out if his gentlemanly skills are up to scratch...

The Oort Cloud is believed to be a vast cosmic shell at the edge of our Solar System that astronomers have never directly seen. The colossal structure contains trillions of icy bodies and stretches nearly a light-year radius from our Sun, taking light weeks to reach its inner edge. Within, ancient chunks of ice larger than mountains drift in endless orbits, occasionally disturbed by passing stars that send them plunging toward the inner solar system as comets and potential hazards to Earth. So if no one has ever seen it, how do we know it even exists? In addition to a general overview of the Oort Cloud, I’ll address the reasons why some scientists question its existence.

Not just because of the verticality and fluidity it introduced to traversal, but also because of its vital role in combat--whether you were incorporating Silkbind attacks into combos or using the Wire-dash to avoid certain death by the skin of your teeth. The Wirebug was a fantastic addition, and yet its absence is something I never really felt in Monster Hunter Wilds. Such is the strength of its combat, the seamlessness of its open world, and the impact both of these facets have on a core gameplay loop that remains infinitely compelling. There are a few missteps along the way--of both an artistic and technical variety--but Wilds is another excellent entry in Capcom's beloved series.For seasoned veterans, that core gameplay loop will be instantly recognizable. You hunt monsters, craft their parts to make better weapons and armor, and then use these upgrades to hunt even more challenging monsters. It's an evergreen formula, although an emphasis on narrative hasn't always been part of the equation. The lone exception is 2018's Monster Hunter World, and in many ways, Wilds feels like a continuation of that game's approach to storytelling. By integrating Guild and Village quests into one cohesive story with multiple characters and a fully voiced protagonist, Capcom clearly intends for the story to be more than the afterthought it has traditionally been.The game's opening moments see the Hunter's Guild arrive in the Forbidden Lands: an uncharted region believed to be uninhabited for the past thousand-odd years. This misconception changed, however, when a young boy named Nata was discovered near the border. Pensive and frightened, Nata recounts how his village was attacked by a fearsome monster known as the White Wrath, forcing the Hunter's Guild to embark on an expedition to investigate this mysterious creature and potentially save Nata's Indigenous people from annihilation. As a hunter, it's your role to slay a bestiary of monsters and protect the balance of the ecosystem in this dangerous new frontier.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Ukrainian Women Who Stayed Behind</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfZSVGqYYcU</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/JfZSVGqYYcU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 09:00:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Since Russia's full-scale invasion, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian men have joined the military.

And this apparently created friction with OBS Studio, the free/open-source screencasting and streaming app. 

"We are now considering the Fedora Flatpaks distribution of OBS Studio a hostile fork," OBS Studio lead Joel Bethke posted in on GitLab's page for Fedora Flatpaks. They said they were making "a formal request to remove all of our branding, including but not limited to, our name, our logo, any additional IP belonging to the OBS Project, from your distribution. Failure to comply may result in further legal action taken...." (Issues with Fedora's packaging led "to users complaining upstream thinking they are being served the official package..." Bethke said in his original Issue. "I would also like some sort of explanation on why someone thought it was a good idea to take a Flatpak that was working perfectly fine, break it, and publish it at a higher priority to our official builds.") 

23 people clicked "Like" on the original Issue — but threatening legal action only happened after Bethke felt Fedora was unresponsive, according to It's FOSS:
In a comment on a video by Brodi Robertson (check pinned comment), Joel shared that folks from Fedora were not taking this issue seriously, with one of them even resorting to name-calling by labeling the OBS Studio devs as being "terrible maintainers". Since then, a major step has been taken by Neal Gompa, a well-known Fedora contributor and member of the Fedora Engineering Steering Committee (FESCo). He has opened a new issue to remove Fedora's OBS Studio flatpak from the registry as soon as possible. 
But by Tuesday Bethke posted in a new comment on GitLab announcing that "a very good conversation" with the Flatpak SIG and Fedora Project Leader seemed to have cleared the tension. "We discussed the issues, how we got here, and what next steps are... [T]he OBS Project is no longer requesting a removal of IP or rebrand of the OBS Studio application provided by Fedora Flatpaks." To the issue of not knowing where to report bugs for the downstream package, "We had some very good discussion on how this might be accomplished in the medium-long term, but don't consider it a blocker at this point." As for other issues with Fedora's Flatpak for OBS Studio, "The discussion was positive and they are actively working to resolve..." 

And similar sentiments were echoed on Fedora's own issue tracker. "We had a good conversation today, and there is a hopeful path forward that does not require the OBS Project distancing itself from Fedora Flatpaks..."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Soho: London&apos;s Most Notorious Neighbourhood</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/soho-londons-most-notorious-neighbourhood</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/67b85b7161b0b0034978a439/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=XmRGXDSfjZDg2qWbQDZfaox2_QT4byoFAB_X1QSIGTc" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Soho was once a thriving melting pot of speakeasies, sex work and organised crime.

Linux's second-in-command Greg Kroah-Hartman has also been a big proponent of Rust kernel code. He's crafted another Linux kernel mailing list post [Wednesdsay] outlining the benefits of Rust and encouraging new kernel code/drivers to be in Rust rather than C. Greg KH makes the case that the majority of the kernel bugs are due to "stupid little corner cases in C that are totally gone in Rust." 

"As someone who has seen almost EVERY kernel bugfix and security issue for the past 15+ years... and who sees EVERY kernel CVE issued, I think I can speak on this topic," Kroah-Hartman began. Here's some excerpts from his remarks. Citing corner cases like overwrites of memory, error path cleanups, use-after-free mistakes and forgetting to check error values, Kroah-Hartman says he's "all for... making these types of problems impossible to hit."

That's why I'm wanting to see Rust get into the kernel, these types of issues just go away, allowing developers and maintainers more time to focus on the REAL bugs that happen (i.e. logic issues, race conditions, etc.)... [F]or new code / drivers, writing them in Rust where these types of
bugs just can't happen (or happen much much less) is a win for all of
us, why wouldn't we do this...? Rust isn't a "silver bullet" that will solve all of our problems, but it sure will help in a huge number of places, so for new stuff going forward, why wouldn't we want that...? 

Yes, mixed language codebases are rough, and hard to maintain, but we are kernel developers dammit, we've been maintaining and strengthening Linux for longer than anyone ever thought was going to be possible. We've turned our development model into a well-oiled engineering marvel creating something that no one else has ever been able to accomplish. Adding another language really shouldn't be a problem, we've handled much worse things in the past and we shouldn't give up now on wanting to ensure that our project succeeds for the next 20+ years. We've got to keep pushing forward when confronted with new good ideas, and embrace the people offering to join us in actually doing the work to help make sure that we all succeed together. 

Kroah-Hartman emphasized later that "a huge majority of the stupid things we do in C just don't happen in the same code implemented in Rust (i.e. memory leaks, error path cleanups, return value checking, etc.) " 

The complete thread contains over 140 messages — including Linus Torvalds' observation that " #pragma is complete garbage and should never be used."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Argentina&apos;s Memecoin Disaster</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqZ0q6cuYs</link><author>Patrick Boyle</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/qdqZ0q6cuYs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 15:45:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw">Patrick Boyle</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Get 50% off your first order of CookUnity meals — go to https://cookunity.com/pboyle50 and use my code PBOYLE50 at checkout to try them out for yourself!

Argentina’s president Javier Milei has been rocked by a scandal over his promotion of a memecoin called $LIBRA which soared in value before collapsing last week, triggering lawsuits and calls for impeachment.

Buyers of the cryptocurrency accused the coin’s creators of - what is known as a “rug pull” scheme, a type of crypto pump and dump scheme - where the promoters draw in buyers, only to stop trading and make off with the money raised from token sales.

The same team who launched the Argentina linked meme token are also behind Donald Trump's wife's Melania Coin - which performed similarly.

In today's video we discuss whether elected representatives should be involved in cryptocurrency investments.

Highlights from Torvalds' response:

The fact is, the pull request you objected to DID NOT TOUCH THE DMA LAYER AT ALL. It was literally just another user of it, in a completely separate subdirectory, that didn't change the code you maintain in _any_ way, shape, or form... Honestly, what you have been doing is basically saying "as a DMA maintainer I control what the DMA code is used for". 

And that is not how *any* of this works. What's next? Saying that particular drivers can't do DMA, because you don't like that device, and as a DMA maintainer you control who can use the DMA code? That's _literally_ exactly what you are trying to do with the Rust code. You are saying that you disagree with Rust — which is fine, nobody has ever required you to write or read Rust code. But then you take that stance to mean that the Rust code cannot even use or interface to code you maintain... 

You don't have to like Rust. You don't have to care about it. That's been made clear pretty much from the very beginning, that nobody is forced to suddenly have to learn a new language, and that people who want to work purely on the C side can very much continue to do so. So to get back to the very core of your statement: 

 "The document claims no subsystem is forced to take Rust" 

that is very much true. You are not forced to take any Rust code, or care about any Rust code in the DMA code. You can ignore it... 

You can't have it both ways. You can't say "I want to have nothing to do with Rust", and then in the very next sentence say "And that means that the Rust code that I will ignore cannot use the C interfaces I maintain".... So when you change the C interfaces, the Rust people will have to deal with the fallout, and will have to fix the Rust bindings. That's kind of the promise here: there's that "wall of protection" around C developers that don't want to deal with Rust issues in the promise that they don't *have* to deal with Rust. 

But that "wall of protection" basically goes both ways. If you don't want to deal with the Rust code, you get no *say* on the Rust code. Put another way: the "nobody is forced to deal with Rust" does not imply "everybody is allowed to veto any Rust code".
 
Torvalds also made sure to add some kind remarks, including "I respect you technically, and I like working with you."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Challenge with Voice Agents</title><link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/mlops/episodes/The-Challenge-with-Voice-Agents-e2v7kj7</link><author>Demetrios</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/98865191/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-1-22%2F395336812-44100-2-5e30b9d18237d.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 14:50:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://mlops.community/">Podcast - MLOps</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In Agents in Production Series - Episode Two, Demetrios, Paul, and Floris explore the latest in Voice AI agents.

All passport applicants should be allowed to select whatever gender markers they feel best fit, including M, F, or X.In humans, neither sex nor gender is binary at any level. There are several possible arrangements of sex chromosomes: X, XX, XY, XXY, XYY, XXX, tetrasomies, pentasomies, etc. A single person can contain a mosaic of cells with different genetics: some XX, some XYY. Chromosomes may not align with genitalia: people with XY chromosomes may have a vulva and internal testes. People with XY chromosomes and a small penis may be surgically and socially reassigned female at birth—and never told what happened. None of these biological dimensions necessarily align with one’s internal concept of gender, or one’s social presentation.The executive order has no idea how biology works. It defines “female” as “a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell”. Zygotes do not produce reproductive cells at all: under this order none  of us have a sex. Oogenesis doesn’t start until over a month into embryo development. Even if people were karyotyping their zygotes immediately after conception so they could tell what “legal” sex they were going to be, they could be wrong: which gametes we produce depends on the formation of the genital ridge.All this is to say that if people fill out these forms using this definition of sex, they’re guessing at a question which is both impossible to answer and socially irrelevant. You might be one of the roughly two percent of humans born with an uncommon sexual development and not even know it. Moreover, the proposed change fundamentally asks the wrong question: gender markers on passports are used by border control agents, and are expected to align with how those agents read the passport holder’s gender. A mismatch will create needless intimidation and hardship for travelers.Of course most of us will not have our identities challenged under this order. That animus is reserved for trans people, for gender-non-conforming people, for anyone whose genetics, body, dress, voice, or mannerisms don’t quite fit the mold. Those are the people who will suffer under this order. That cruelty should be resisted.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Change my mind (Friends)</title><link>https://changelog.com/friends/81</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/friends/81/changelog--friends-81.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 21:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Jerod and Adam use Chris Kiehl’s post on development topics he’s changed his mind on (over the last 10 years) as a proxy for discussion on dev things they HAVE and HAVE NOT changed their minds on.Changelog++ members save 9 minutes on this episode because they made the ads disappear.

But Cabernet dares to go deeper with its message, delving into the cyclical nature of humanity's cruelty to each other, especially regarding the treatment of the lower class, and how society's many ills are often the result of the new rich inheriting the evils of the old. It all makes for a deeply compelling consequence-driven story where every choice carries the potential to surprise you with terrifying force. Some late-game glitches mar the game's fantastic conclusion, but even if developer Party for Introverts doesn't address those issues in post-launch updates, the journey to get to Cabernet's final hour is an incredible piece of interactive fiction.A 2D narrative-driven RPG set in 19th century Eastern Europe, Cabernet begins with protagonist Liza's funeral, as you briefly roleplay as her uncle and give a eulogy that determines the direction of Liza's life and which skills she specializes in. Control then shifts to Liza as you awake in a dungeon. Unsure of how she got there, Liza makes a pact with an unseen and silent presence for freedom, before finding herself at a party filled with vampires. It quickly becomes apparent that she is now a vampire as well, and this new life comes with a ton of rules, like needing to satiate a constant thirst for blood and staying away from sunlight. But there are immense freedoms associated with the transformation as well, as Liza is empowered with supernatural abilities that allow her to go to places she never could before, get away with acts others are often swiftly arrested for, and pursue passions and love most mortals of her station cannot yet readily do.In this sense, Liza is a stand-in for the middle class, which was emerging during this period in real-life history. Liza cannot relate to the centuries-old Countess who commands all the vampires in the region and lives in a mansion filled with wealth, nor can she completely empathize with the poor farmer girl who dreams of learning music and bettering herself but must toil away in the fields for hours so her family can eat. But Liza can take small steps into both of their worlds to see their respective trials and tribulations, and although she cannot fundamentally change the relationship between the poor and rich, she is one of the few in town who can affect the lives of people in both social spheres. This setup grounds the otherwise supernatural fantasy in real-world politics, implementing considerations into the story that give even the simplest of choices substantial narrative weight.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft’s new chip looks like science fiction…</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwnez8HdN7E</link><author>Fireship</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/jwnez8HdN7E?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 18:24:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA">Dev - Fireship</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Sign up for CodeRabbit using FIRESHIP code, and get free CodeRabbit for 1-month https://bit.ly/41rLUxm

How did the universe begin? How can something come from nothing? One way to “solve” this most difficult of philosophical conundrums is to avoid it altogether. Maybe the universe didn’t begin. Maybe the Big Bang was just one in an endless cycle.
