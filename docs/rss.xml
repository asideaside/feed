This isn’t just demanded of us as a publicly listed company, but as the result of a structural shift within the industry as a whole. In fact, the anime market has grown two-fold over the last 10 years to be currently worth over 3 trillion yen, and of this, 1.6 trillion yen is in the Japanese market alone. It is now to the point where anime has lost the ‘Cool Japan’ tag and is now considered to be a major industry on the global stage. However, for a while there, admittedly, our creators were handling excessive workloads, but a report from the United Nations Commission of Inquiry in October 2023 shedding light on labor conditions within the anime industry has garnered international attention on the issue (with discussions reaching the point of whether or not to release details on Netflix, etc.) causing the industry to rethink and apply global standards to traditional working methods that have propped up the anime industry up until now. We are fully aware of these issues having received our own recommendations with regards to the Subcontractor Act in Japan. For our hard-working creators, we need to adopt measures that may be seen as rather strict regulations at times, but this is a necessary path we have to take for the betterment of the industry as a whole.To address this, we are implementing measures such as improvements to workflows and eliminating excessive working hours by working with the Corporate Planning Office in particular to come up with fundamental ways to resolve such structural issues. We also feel like we are coming together as an industry through collaborations with other companies in the industry and media mix projects.As a company at the forefront of the industry, here at COVER we are not content with just simply addressing compliance issues, but rather proactively providing information and making efforts to ensure the steady development of the industry as a whole. This is absolutely necessary to continue to develop Japanese anime and VTubing as an entertainment industry we can be proud of, which includes improving our efforts in ensuring that talents and creators can thrive under sustainable working conditions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ninomae Ina&apos;nis and SUSHIRO HONG KONG Team Up for the First-Ever hololive English Collaboration Starting August 13! | NEWS - ホロライブ公式サイト</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaEFVX3lxTE9EV1V3TlA2Y3d2OFVjeWxwODhlZzRfeVdnSDJFdWstdVVSTmhiU3hwWG1lOUQtMWRQNTRuS1hjbTVMY1AyRUNNYl8tVjEyTXBZRmlSTUNWcnJIWWxHVVJ2N0ZUSGpOLThx?oc=5</link><author></author><category>hololive</category><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 09:21:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.google.com/topics/CAAqKAgKIiJDQkFTRXdvTkwyY3ZNVEZuWDNKc2EyaDRjQklDWlc0b0FBUAE?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;ceid=US:en">hololive on Google News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ninomae Ina’nis and SUSHIRO HONG KONG Team Up for the First-Ever hololive English Collaboration Starting August 13!</title><link>https://hololivepro.com/news_en/20250813-01-185/</link><author>os_pr</author><category>hololive</category><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 08:55:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hololivepro.com/">hololive Official News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[August 13, 2025, Tokyo, JAPAN – COVER Corporation (Minato-ku, Tokyo; CEO: Tanigo Motoaki) has announced that hololive English -Myth- talent Ninomae Ina’nis will be teaming up with SUSHIRO HONG KONG for the first-ever hololive English collaboration.

The quarter delivered a large top-line jump driven by one particularly successful product line, while the company also pushed hard on infrastructure, technology and overseas expansion. That combination produced solid absolute profits but compressed margins compared with the company’s best historical quarters.Below is a full read of the quarter: the numbers, what caused them, how Cover is allocating capital, the tensions and risks this creates, and the structural strengths that make this a meaningful pivot rather than a one-off spike.Cash & Cash Equivalents (end Q1)(Values and percent changes from Cover Corp Q1 presentation.)Where the growth came fromThe dominant story for the quarter is merchandising — specifically, the launch and rapid scale of the hololive OFFICIAL CARD GAME (TCG). Merchandising accounted for roughly  of Q1 revenue (about ¥5.84B of ¥9.63B). The TCG moved Cover from a diversified-revenue mix into a quarter where a single product family was the largest contributor.Figure — Q1 revenue mix: merchandising was roughly 60% of sales this quarter.Why the TCG matters: it combines recognizable IP, repeat purchase cycles (new sets, booster releases), event-driven demand (tournaments and league play) and collectible economics. Those characteristics make it high-leverage for an IP-first company: strong unit economics on physical product, recurring drop cycles, and community-driven engagement that feeds back into virtual events and content.That concentration is important — it produced the big topline move, but it also creates a single-point dependency for quarterly performance.Profits, margins and the investment trade-offCover delivered higher absolute profits (operating profit ¥972M, net profit ¥693M), but margins show the impact of active reinvestment.Figure — Gross, operating and net margins for the quarter (rounded).: strong. The merchandising-heavy mix, where merchandise typically carries healthier gross margins than pure streaming revenue, lifted gross profitability.: positive but compressed relative to periods without heavy upfront investment. The company reports increasing R&D, logistics consolidation and overseas setup costs that absorb a portion of the gross uplift.: likewise positive but indicates a significant share of revenue is consumed by the non-operating items and tax/interest compared with gross profit.Put simply: revenue growth translated into higher gross profit, but Cover deliberately reallocated a chunk of that cash into investments intended to expand future capacity and quality — which lowered the percent of revenue that flowed through to operating profit this quarter.Where Cover is spending — the “build” phaseCover describes its current actions as foundational: spending now for capabilities that should help scale the business and diversify revenue later. The main categories of investment called out in the quarter:Expressive technology & R&D — more advanced 3D/live concert tooling, motion capture workflows, and production technology that enable richer, more interactive shows and collaboration with external partners.Logistics and supply chain — a consolidated logistics center began full operation on , intended to shorten delivery times and reduce per-order handling costs as volumes grow.Overseas expansion & local channels — building localized EC presence and licensing relationships in North America and other regions to reduce cross-border friction and capture more local demand.Content and event production capacity — more concerts, larger productions, and supplemental studio/staff investment to raise product quality and live-event scale.Management also presented a medium-term investment plan that contemplates roughly  of cumulative growth investments (including M&A) through FY2030, paired with an ambition to reach ~¥100 billion in revenue and ¥25 billion in operating profit by that horizon. Those numbers frame the current investments as strategic and multi-year rather than simply tactical.Balance sheet — runway exists, for nowCover finished Q1 with about  in cash and equivalents. The company is profitable in absolute terms and holds a meaningful cash cushion. That balance sheet provides runway to fund the medium-term build-out and to absorb some execution hiccups — but it does not eliminate the need for measured returns on the substantial planned investments.Because the company intends large, multi-year capital and M&A commitments, the health of the balance sheet will depend on the pace at which investment converts into recurring revenue and margin expansion.Risks and friction points made explicit in the reportSeveral concrete risks are visible in the Q1 materials:Concentration risk (TCG dependency): merchandising’s outsized contribution (nearly +100% YoY growth) is heavily tied to the TCG. If demand softens, or if competitors or product fatigue reduce momentum, merchandising could normalize sharply.Trade policy and tariffs: management noted a tariff-driven hit to North American e-commerce that temporarily cut monthly sales from that region to roughly half prior-year levels at one stage. International trade policy is an external variable that affected EC performance and pushes the company to localize sales channels.Rising fixed costs and execution risk: new logistics, studios, staff and technology create a higher fixed cost base. If revenue growth doesn’t keep pace or new products take longer to mature, margins could be pressured. retirements reduced membership/streaming revenue in the quarter. A business rooted in performers will always carry talent risk — retirements, image issues, or turnover can materially affect engagement and related revenue.These are not hypothetical risks; they are the issues the company called out and positioned as active items to manage.Strengths and structural positivesAlongside these risks there are structural positives worth noting:Proven product-market fit for a physical IP product. The TCG demonstrated tangible ability to convert virtual talent and fandom into a mainstream hobby product, with tournament and community play amplifying demand.Licensing & partner momentum. The company is expanding licensing relationships and working to monetize IP across platforms and territories — a natural path for an IP-first company that can linearize its fanbase into multiple product categories.Operational upgrades that compound. The logistics center and supply-chain consolidation can reduce marginal shipping costs and delivery headaches as volume increases; technology investments (Holoearth and expressive tech) can yield differentiated experiences that are harder to replicate.Positive absolute profitability and cash buffers. Cover is not burning cash this quarter; it is generating operating profit while building. That gives management flexibility to absorb execution variance and pursue strategic expansion.Looking forward — what the next few quarters will revealThis quarter is the start of a new phase: the charts and numbers show a business that converted IP into a high-volume merchandising product and then immediately reinvested that success into infrastructure and product expansion. The next few quarters will be the test:Is merchandising strength repeatable beyond the immediate launch windows of the TCG?Does localization and supply-chain work blunt the tariff impacts and restore more stable overseas growth?Will the investment program start to generate margin expansion, or will the fixed-cost base outpace revenue increases?Answers to those questions will determine whether Q1 is the opening chapter of durable scale or a high-water mark that requires careful management to sustain.Cover’s Q1 is a mixture of a clear success and deliberate risk-taking. The company turned a major IP product into a dominant, high-margin revenue source for the quarter and used that momentum to finance infrastructure and capability-building. That approach has solid rationale: merchandising and events coupled with improved logistics and expressive tech can turn transient product spikes into sustainable revenue platforms. But it also creates execution dependencies — concentration around a single product line, external policy exposures, and a heavier fixed-cost base.Numbers this quarter are real and meaningful: strong revenue growth, improved gross profit, positive operating profit and a healthy cash position. The key question is whether the investments now under way will diversify and stabilize revenue while improving long-term margins — or whether the company will need to adjust if merchandising cools and the new fixed costs remain high. The Q1 slides make both the upside and the risks explicit; the next few quarterly reports will tell which direction the company’s execution takes.Cover Corp FY2026/3 Q1 presentation (financial results

As a business, we naturally need to focus on driving revenue – but our resources aren’t unlimited. And from the talent side, they each have projects they want to pursue too, while also managing their regular streams, preparing for anniversary events, and planning other special content. So they’re constantly juggling a lot. Back in 2023, when Shishiro Hai was just getting off the ground, one of the biggest challenges was figuring out how the company could expand its support among the resources limitations that exist on both the company and talent sides.So I approached my manager with a proposal: “Maybe we can generate revenue in ways that go beyond the traditional model if we can turn the things our talents genuinely want to do into business opportunities.” That way the talents get to pursue what they’re passionate about, and the company can allocate resources accordingly if it’s a viable revenue stream. It’s a win-win for everyone. Shishiro Hai was a perfect example of this: it became a way to bring Shishiro Botan’s passion to life, while also creating opportunities for sponsorship and monetization.Fortunately, I happened to be in the sales department at that time, which allowed me to casually sound out a few trusted companies and get an early read on their interest. That helped me sketch out a rough budget plan and move forward with an internal proposal, which was officially approved on the condition that it would be monetized properly from the very first installment. In her interview, Shishiro Botan mentioned that “there wasn’t a lot of movement” after our initial discussions but the truth is that this was the time when I was working behind the scenes to try and get everyone on board! lol.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Relive the Magic of hololive night 2025!</title><link>https://hololivepro.com/news_en/20250731-01-179/</link><author>narita</author><category>hololive</category><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 01:46:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hololivepro.com/">hololive Official News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On July 5, 2025, the much-anticipated second collaboration between hololive production and the Los Angeles Dodgers took place in Los Angeles, California at the Dodger Stadium!Starring Ninomae Ina’nis, IRyS, and Koseki Bijou from hololive English, the event was full of exciting activities that ran in tandem with the game — which included a live sing-a-long of “Take Me Out to the Ball Game” during the 7th inning stretch, unique hype videos, and a special first pitch by YAGOO himself!Aside from in-game features, attendees were also able to enjoy pre- and post-game activities, such as an unprecedented world-first VTuber livestream to and from Dodger Stadium. It was a night to remember for both fans of hololive and the L.A. Dodgers!The game started with YAGOO taking to the field to throw the first pitch. Mascot characters Subaru Duck and UDIN also made an appearance on the field, watching over YAGOO as he threw the ceremonial first pitch.Soon after, Ninomae Ina’nis, IRyS, and Koseki Bijou greeted hololive production and Dodgers fans alike with the iconic phrase said before every Dodger game – “It’s time for Dodger baseball!”  And with that, the game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Houston Astros began!As the match continued, exclusive hype videos from the three talents were broadcast to the stadium, encouraging fans to show their support for the Dodgers. At the 7th inning stretch, all three talents led the crowd in a passionate performance of  the classic baseball anthem “Take Me Out to the Ball Game”. The passion was certainly felt, as the crowd’s  cheers echoed throughout the stadium at the encouragement of Ninomae Ina’nis, IRyS, and Koseki Bijou.But outside of the “in-game” entertainment, guests were able to indulge in a range of activities for a full ‘hololive’ experience. Attendees received special hololive night trading cards upon entry, this time featuring Ninomae Ina’nis, IRyS, and Koseki Bijou dressed for the occasion in their very own Los Angeles Dodgers uniforms. The line for attendees to get their hands on these exclusive trading cards stretched well into the parking lot, showing just how much enthusiasm there was for the return of this collaboration.Located around the stadium were various photo spots for attendees to take pictures with the featured talents in the form of life-sized cutouts with themed backgrounds. Subaru Duck and UDIN also made a special appearance for photos. Fans in their commemorative jerseys, cosplays, and casual wear stood in line to take pictures with their favorite talent, memorializing  the moment in the form of a photograph.There was no shortage of special merchandise to purchase! Commemorative towels, lanyards, stickers, T-Shirts, can cooler, and acrylic stands themed after the event were available to purchase at the stadium. The collaboration merchandise features all three featured talents in Los Angeles Dodgers signature blue and white branding, capturing the spirit of the team with hololive production talents together. And just like the line for the trading cards, the merchandise booths were packed with eager fans looking to get their hands on these goods.For those that purchased popcorn or soda (or a beer) to enjoy at the game, special commemorative cups and popcorn buckets were distributed to attendees. Each of these items featured unique packaging with illustrations of Ninomae Ina’nis, IRyS, and Koseki Bijou in their uniforms.To wrap up the collaboration event, a special Post-Game Special Program was held on the field.
As fans stepped onto the field, Ninomae Ina’nis, IRyS, and Koseki Bijou appeared on the big screen, and the world’s first ever VTuber live stream to and from Dodger Stadium began!
Fans all around the world were able to join in the Post-Game Special Program in real time alongside the audience at Dodger Stadium!The experience included interactive segments such as a “Staring Contest”, where talents competed with fans on the field in a game of endurance, and “WHO’s Got the MOVES?!” dance challenge where attendees danced along to the choruses of beloved hololive production songs.But that’s not all! Throughout the night, surprise videos messages from hololive English -Myth-, hololive English -Promise-, hololive English -Advent-, and hololive English -Justice- kept the energy high with their cheer.Towards the end of the event, highlight videos from previous hololive English concerts and concert events were shown, leading up to performances of songs like “Connect the World,” “Breaking Dimensions,” and “Our Bright Parade”.
The energy among the fans reached its peak as the event drew to a powerful and unforgettable climax.The night ended in excitement, with fans of both the Los Angeles Dodgers and hololive experiencing the best of both worlds.Date: July 5th, 2025 4:15 PM (PDT)
Venue: Dodger Stadium (Los Angeles, CA)

Her responses are as wild and delightful as you’d expect… and definitely worth checking out!If you missed the AMA, or just want to relive the fun, be sure to take a look at her answers below!Here are Kureiji Ollie’s Answers to Your Questions
I think it was the first fes that I’ve participated in- I was proud of myself when I sang with Haachama-senpai! I still get compliments for that one performance, and I’ll use it as my biggest milestone ever!
Believe it or not, there has never been a Halloween-themed collab before! I’m not only talking about the dead beings, but also the demons, succubuses talents we have in hololive! So I’d like to do a hololive Halloween special one day! 👀✨️
It was during a viewer-participation among us stream, somebody suggested the name and I thought it’d be funny to name him Udin lololol Funfact tho! I was originally about to name him Josephine!👀
I don’t have much stories for FLOWGLOW but I did went on a date with Chihaya! 🎧🔧 She was the kouhai yet she was the one taking care of me when I was at Japan, she even gave me a brief explanation for Gundam! As for Justice, and I won’t stop talking about this, was when Gigi and Cecilia were in their own world eating strawberry daifuku 🍓🌷 (lowkey ship them)
I want to play more with the ReGLOSS members! I’ve only ever collabed with Ririka once, I want to collab with the other ReGLOSS members too!
BIG NO. LET ME BE THE ONLY ZOMBIE THANK YOU VERY MUCH 👁👁🧟‍♀️
That we have an annual company party with every talent and every staff like in those idol animes- I’ve realized we don’t do that cause everyone is too busy 🥲
Very fun! I’ve never felt more alive! Even though I’m a zombie, hehe
Me but with big boobs.
I’m not that loud anymore, I speak English most of the time, and I’m not always horny I promise 🥹🥹
If I don’t work then I can’t pay bills, as simple as that uwu
I usually just stop when it starts straining me~ Knowing when your streaming limit is very important! Better to rest for a day than be burnt out for a whole month 👍✨️
I feel like if I auditioned now then I wouldn’t be able to make it KSKSKSKKSK the level of entertainment needed to pass auditions is CRAZY (no pun intended) and I’ve always felt lucky that I managed to get in when I had little very little experience 👀 As for ambassadors hmmmmm I think we’ll just have to wait and see~!!
I’ve said this a lot on stream and I won’t ever stop recommending Yogyakarta! It’s a province with more Indonesian cultures and is budget-friendly, even for Indonesians! ✨️
There’s also Lembang, it’s high in the mountains and it has beautiful scenery and lots of tourist spots! It’s definitely a local go-to 🌄✨️
Someone who’s professional but also friendly! Having too much of one of these qualities makes it a bit hard for me to lead/follow, so definitely someone that has a good balance in between!👍
Blue Prince! I’ve been wanting to play it but I keep forgetting 😩
My family was financially in the gutters and I had to share a meal with 4 of my family members… I couldn’t do the things that I wanted because there was no money for it, and I had a student loan with my uncle. The only thing I did was study and survive. Being in hololive changed my whole life, and my family’s too. I get to do the things I want and get an income out of it- I wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world 🫶💞
As a fan-turned-idol, I like how I’m able to see what both worlds look like- I love how I can nerd out with fans and also work towards the same goals with my beloved hololivers 🫶💖
I visioned myself just playing games, now I’m performing for world tour 👁👄👁 I honestly don’t know what the future holds~
Schedules and staying relevant is hard- You can’t come up with banger tweets everyday and there’s so much more to vtubing than just streaming so it gets hard 😭😭
This is pretty much impossible, but I kinda want to see hololive making its own anime series 👀
Wanting to go to hololive pop-up stores/collab cafes
I’ve always wanted to be a voice actor, but I couldn’t be one so VTuber is kinda my next best thing 👉👈
I’m optimistic that it’ll only grow bigger from now! hololive has also been cooking so many innovations behind the screen, so I’m confident to say that maybe we’ll be as well-known as Hatsune Miku! 🔥🔥
There’s a solo concert that I really want to do, but I think that’s still a long way for me!
I mostly remember the down parts, there was actually a time where I would cry on membership streams for a whole year every week lol (I’m all fine now tho! :DDD) And I think my peak is actually right now?! I’ve beem provided so many great opportunities, holoplus include 🥹🫶💞 (thanks holoplus team 🫰) As for nendoroids and figmas, we’ll just have to be patient! It takes two to tango and hololive is doing their best to get us the nendos! ✨️✨️
Someone who makes other people happy by doing what they love 💖
1. holoplus is a space where you could oshikatsu TO THE MAX with fan focused features and the latest oshi news! 2. I hope more people will use holoplus more because it’s honestly so convenient! Also I hope that the features that are being cooked gets released soon uashdvaudva the team is working sooo harddd❤️‍❤️‍
AMOGUS
The hololive song that I listen to the most has to be “A Horny Money World”!! I’ve been listening to it ever since Marine-senpai’s live 🔥🔥
It’s still my proudest piece yet! My hololive Medllie (Medley + Ollie)✨️✨️ It’s my gratitude for hololive fans and the hololive talents that kept on inspiring me 💞💞
Mau jadi ambassador UNIQLO, sama-sama merah uwu
Kanata-senpai’s “Bessekai” is my ultimate favorite, it’s so beautiful and delicate, the lyrics are relatable for me and I find it poetic and beautiful 💙
It was a recent stream, but I really like the Valentine’s stream I did this 2025! The one with the maid competition! It was so fun to plan something so simple yet so fun! It doesn’t have the most views, but I felt nothing but joy for that one stream~
Okay IMAGINE THIS: ✨️A BACKSCRATCHER IN THE FORM OF OLLIE’S ARM✨️ hehe~ My zomily gave me this idea and I’d LOVE for this to happen 🥹🥹💞 *winkwonkmanagementpleaseletthisbeathing
Reine is the “putri merak yang tertiup angin”, meaning she’s a peafowl princess blown from the wind, so I think it’d be SICK to make a fan (literal fan) merch for her! 🌬💨🍃
Everyone’s faces and reactions, of course! Seeing you guys are what I’m most excited about 🫰💞💞 (setidaknya bisa lihat muka)
IS THAT EVEN A QUESTION⁉️⁉️💖💞❣️🌷🔥✨️🎉💃
Being a vtuber is COSTLY; even as a corp Vtuber, I put out so much of my savings for projects like 3D Lives, original songs, collab projects, etc! So make sure you’re doing this because you like Vtubing. Please don’t pressure yourself to make covers or big projects if you’re not emotionally, mentally, or financially prepared. You don’t need to rush, things takes time, so be kind to yourself and your wallet.
✨️THEIR WITTINESS✨️ When Vtubers know the perfect things to say on the perfect time, that’s the ideal Vtuber~ A few examples are Laplus and Fubuki-senpai!
I’ll be frank, the bar is VEEEEERYYYY high right now… The only tip that I can give you is if you have a talent/personality that hololive doesn’t have yet! Let’s say for example uh… An opera singer?
My first ever work from holoplus was to give them ideas and suggestions on what the talents/fans would maybe like to see in holoplus! This QnA is actually my second work as the ambassador, and we’ll have plenty of fun things prepared in the future!
There’s so many questions asking what I’m most excited for and I can’t actually tell you guys cause it’s going to be a surprise 👀
Things aren’t always that complicated, slow down and take your time processing everything uwu (I was very impatient back then)
This is a tough one 🤔 I’ve had my dream collab with Indomie/PopMie, so I never really thought about it! But if I had to shoot for the sky… CROCS!! I love wearing Crocs!! :DDD
Dulu Ollie dipaksa harus tinggalin mimpi Ollie hanya karena nggak mampu… Pas denger audisi Vtuber, bagi Ollie itu bagaikan kesempatan terakhir Ollie untuk wujudin mimpi- jadi Ollie kejar terus sampe dapet pokoknya!!!
I feel like we can determine the vector by considering “does this degrade my oshi” and “will this offend anyone else than my oshi”! It might be a hardline to read especially if you’re trying to do an edgy joke, so I usually rewrite my jokes so that it’s a lot more seiso!
Different types of music inspires me in different ways! As for lately, I’ve been inspired by cute-kawaii pop songs! 🫶🌷🍓✨️
Lucu aja AOWKOWKWOWKWOK
Internet connections/obs dying 🥲 I also hate it when I get one-guyed, I hate myself whenever I fall for it 😭😭
I dream of a collab with JaidenAnimations (now that she’s also a vtuber!), maybe a Pokémon collab?? uuuuuuu that’d be great 🥹🥹
Cyndaquil LOVE 🫶🔥
I don’t know if other countries have this or not, but we have QRIS where we pay everything with a QR code 📲 And I think we use QR codes for a lot of stuffs! Social media, restaurant menus, transactions, etc! Pretty handy! OH and we also rent powerbanks in malls so that’s a win too~
I understand 😭😭 Mostly because textbook Indonesian and daily Indonesian are completely different 😭😭 My tips is to have conversations or listen to a lot of Indonesian conversation! SHOCK THERAPHY BABY 🔥🔥 That’s how I forced myself to speak Japanese when I didn’t know the language!
I’m flattered omg??? 😭😭 Thank you, I’m glad you see me as a nice person 🥹🥹 It’s weird giving out advice for kindness, but I usually treat people the way I want them to treat me- so because I’m a needy girl then I try to provide as much care to the people around me! If I were having a bad day, I for sure would love to have someone to cheer me up 🫶
I think you’re talking about kanjis, and the advice that I got from my JP senpais is: don’t sweat the kanjis! JP peeps have trouble with kanjis too wwwwwww But definitely start slow, if you haven’t had your hiragana down then try writing two full pages of 1 letter every single day! That’s how I learned Japanese, and even Arabic! It’s tedious, but this method makes hiragana/katakana stick to me faster!
Honestly, it’ll be easier to learn Japanese once you have the basics down! Start by learning hiragana, and if you’re feeling it, you can try katakana too! After you learn the alphabets, learn how to use Japanese particles like を, に, で, の, は, が etc! I suggest studying from Kirakira nihongo! It’s very easy to follow! After that, just practice your Japanese with a friend or watch JP media without relying on subs! That’s how I learned them! :DDD
Pertanyaannya bikin greget ya- hmm… Boneka Miteiru Jumbo dari Shirakami Fubuki, karena bisa jadi bantal buat ditidurin-
WATCHING VTUBERS FOR 7 YEARS⁉️⁉️ YOU’RE 14⁉️⁉️⁉️🤯🤯 WOW– UM– I really hope you’ve been watching the family-friendly talents kEKW You’ve been watching hololive longer than I have, so I think you should have a proper idea of what hololive looks for in a talent! A lot of factors play into the audition, but what matters is how determined you are in becoming one of us!! ✨️ ONLY audition when you’ve reached age requirement tho, okay?
That’s not the only thing we see 👁👁
I DID………. But then I realized how expensive that would be so I scratched the idea hehe
Pssst don’t tell them but ummm… It’s Kiara-senpai and FUWAMOCO 👉👈💖
amiiiiiiiiin 🙏
Rather than having all of the MMDs public, I think it’s best to do whatever makes the talents happy! Whether they want their MMDs public, or if they want it private 🫶❣️
Like, comment, follow, subscribe~ (no like for real dO IT NOW)
Laplus, I’ve noticed that she’s just so unapologetically her around everyone- She brought a toy horse back stage during holofes for good luck-
Definitely Ina! And always will be Ina! WAH
Elizabeth because she is SUCH a gentlewoman UGHHH💖💖💞💞
I’m sorry Shiori but I stan BloodRaven 💄🎼🫶💖 I’ve carried Kobo plenty of times so yeah!
Roboco, Akirose, Subaru (Choco-sensei is curved but something about Subaru-senpai’s hips got me 😳😳), Marine, Watame I guess?? (gen 4 only has cute members now), Botan, Lui, Ririka, Chihaya, Moona, Reine, Zeta, Kiara, Kronii, Nerissa, Raora- phewww those are my opinions!
It was the holoplus team that reached out to me first and offered me this amazing opportunity! Having given this honorable role, I aspire to invite the community towards a more OSHIKATSU community space and make connections between fans and talents! (I’ll drink water now hehe thank you)
holoplus is honestly an app that I’ve been dreaming of existing (and I’m not saying this because I’m the ambassador hehe) Our focus gets scattered when using other social medias because of outside interest and recommended posts, while in holoplus, we get to entirely invest our focus to hololive! I don’t have to open the hololive schedule website to check for streams, I could do it in holoplus! If I want to know the latest news like new outfits or even 3D Lives, holoplus got me covered! It’s honestly so convenient, I’m just waiting for my own official holoplus account so that I could just start posting here adsfgfhjisheb
Ollie ingin lebih banyak berinteraksi dengan kalian para fans! Waktu jadi ambassador holomeet, Ollie nggak terlalu banyak bekerja- jadi kali ini Ollie pengen lebih aktif lagi!
I’ve given all my ideas to the holoplus team already and a few of them they are already working on so I’ll let this be a surprise for now~
YES
To drag all of you and use this superior app MWAHAHHAHAHAH
WHY WOULD I THINK TWICE ABOUT BECOMING THE AMBASSADOR OF THE HOLOLIVE OSHIKATSU SOCIAL MEDIA??? IT WAS AN IMMEDIATE YESSSS
Um… Blend in… Yeah…
Pros, you’re already dead so nothing kills you and you can pop your head whenever! 🧟‍♀️✨️ Cons, body parts are basically rotting so it’s prone to illnesses and injuries 💦
CYBOOOOORGGG YEAHHHH LASER EYESSSSSSS 🔥🔥🔥
1000 BAJILLION DOLLARS🤑🤑
I’ve always loved Elephants!🐘💖
“Shampoo… *screams at the sight of soap*”
Hard question because every vocaloid song is so good- But the first song that popped in my head was “Neko Neko☆Super Fever Night” because it’s just so hype and I LOVE listening to the niconico utaites singing it together 🐱🐾 Favorite composer is DECO*27! He was the one who made my entire childhood with all his songs, so when I sang the chorus for ZOMBIE it was like a dream come true!!🥰🥰
INAZUMA ELEVEN ⚽️⚡️
Does Raimon Eleven from Inazuma Eleven count-
I was actually shocked that everybody was so supportive! I was ready for people to ramble at me about diet plans and work-out tips- but everybody embraced the chubby belly?!?!?😳😳
Boring answer: I like spending time with friends and family; Other answer: Stalk fan’s twitter accounts
I love comfy and long dresses; I’ve been looking into modern hanfus and traditional qipaos lately!
Tshirts at home- Just Tshirts uwu
Golf is something that I’ve been dying on trying! You just hit a ball and walk with your friends across the field-
Aquariums for sure! It’s just somehow more romantic~
🫂
I’m sorry Shiori but I stan BloodRaven 💄🎼🫶💖 I’ve carried Kobo plenty of times so yeah!
I’ll be so honest with you guys I don’t wishlist or check for sales in Steam at all 😭😭 I usually just buy whatever the other members are playing 🥹🥹
If you’re going to Jakarta, please please PLEASE wear a facemask 😭😭
I guess it’d have to be a Yakitori! It’s basically just a chicken skewer, so I grade them the same level as Satay!🍢
I like anything doughy! Like cake batter ice cream!
It came after I accidentally mistook chocomint ice cream for matcha, my world completely CHANGED
Indomie! :DDD
I’ve never tried it! But I did had a funny story regarding it, apparently a few content creators mistook me for a Philipino and thought that my concept was a knock on Jollibee skskksksks
I’d take them to a Padang Restaurant! They serve a bunch of menus at once even before you order, I think that would be an experience!
Relax and be confident! You just have to look cool to convince the HR team!
No, I’m Indonesian and cheese is so expensive owo
YASSSS
LITERALLY PLEASE INVITE ME TO ANY HAWAII CONVENTIONS I WOULD LOVE TO GO 😭😭
Swiss has been in my bucket list for sooo longg
A glass cabinet!
I’m so bad with horror games KSKSKSKKSKS, but I’m surprisingly unfazed with horror movies/series!
I tried practicing with it but there never was a good moment to actually use it so I just rusted uwu
A lot actually! I get to constantly talk about holoplus, advertise the f out of it, even make streams using holoplus! That’s a plan for another day though~
holoplus is scarily advanced, there’re so many language options, they have channels for different type of posts you want to see, and everything loads like SUPER FAST??? It’s honestly so insane-
This is so embarrassing to answer, but the team said something along the lines of “Ollie is the perfect ambassador and we are confident that you can help us connect to the fans all over the world” uuuuuuu ///////////
Canggih sedap skuy skuy cukurukuk
I might be more active here than in other social medias in the future KEK
I actually love when there’re posts where you guys start discussing and replying to each other, though it’s been really quiet in here… 👀
Not gonna lie, when they first shared the idea of holoplus to the talents, I thought that it’d be hard to achieve because this is essentially making their own social media- so I was actually super surprised at how well made holoplus came to be! Color me surprised when holoplus actually cooked and served! The team did SUCH A GREAT JOB!!!!!
Themed UI would be cool no?! Imagine an Ollie-themed holoplus when you open the app!!!!✨️✨️
Dark mode is always a go-to~
I think it’d be pretty rad if we could connect and multistream our streams in holoplus! Maybe the people watching from holoplus can send in cute stickers on stream or something!
Custom hololive production talents notification sounds! This might sound simple, but if we were to involve all of the talents… Hmm…
I’m so blessed and honored to be trusted with such an amazing role TTTT The team is also so nice to me it’s just so fun being an ambassador!! <3Join the holoplus Community!holoplus offers an extensive variety of content, including original content unique to holoplus that can be enjoyed by everyone, as well as exclusive information in collaboration with large-scale events!Join and take part in building a community for all fans!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ENG | Art vlog 》skebご依頼🎨ムチムチに描くぞー！</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H44RLLckO2w</link><author>Riko-m</author><category>yt-holo</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/H44RLLckO2w?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 13:37:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm4-UmTD1TbYd7V0PBpKVbA">Riko-m</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ご視聴いただきありがとうございます🤍

According to the  (Japan eSports White Paper) 2024 by KADOKAWA ASCII Research Laboratories Inc., Japan’s domestic esports market reached JPY 14.685 billion in 2023 – a 117% increase from the previous year and looking ahead to 2025, the market is expected to approach 20 billion yen in scale. Some companies from a wide range of industries are stepping into the scene, becoming sponsors of professional esports teams and supporting major tournaments and events. Did you know that the worlds of esports and VTubers are coming together more than ever before?For those who aren’t so familiar with gaming, the esports scene and professional tournaments can sometimes feel a bit out of reach, but when it is a VTuber you already follow stepping into the arena, that barrier may not feel quite so high. Fans can cheer on their favorite VTubers as they improve from beginner level to becoming skilled players, and watch them connect with other creators through gaming. In the process, viewers naturally find themselves learning more about the game and enjoying it alongside their favorite talents. Some VTubers have even gone beyond simply practicing on their own, with some embracing being coached by professional esports players to sharpen their skills and improve their chances of winning in tournaments and competitive matches. Coaching sessions are often shared as livestreams or videos, serving as a unique bridge between the esports and VTuber communities, and as these collaborations have continued over time, some VTubers and pro gamers have even developed bonds that feel almost like a mentor/apprentice relationship. The lifelong gamer at heart received coaching from several professional players and steadily streamed her progress reaching Master Rank – a level widely recognized as the mark of an advanced player – in just one year, and has even been interviewed by media outlets about her tips when choosing gaming devices. It was not only her dream to compete in these kinds of tournaments but the challenge of hosting them that led to the creation of Shishiro Hai.With Shishiro Botan taking the lead on tournament planning and day-of operations, and our company supporting coordination with partner organizations, the first Shishiro Hai STREET FIGHTER 6 powered by GALLERIA was held on March 31, 2024. This was followed by a second tournament on October 13-14 of the same year. Perhaps in recognition of her efforts to create and run these events, Shishiro Botan was honored with the title of VTuber of the Year 2024 in the Live Entertainment category at the JAPAN eSPORTS AWARDS 2024, announced at the year’s end.What Makes Shishiro Hai Unique?Online esports tournaments take place all the time in all kinds of formats, but here are a few key reasons why Shishiro Hai is unique.Firstly, Shishiro Botan’s own influence and the strength of her brand have made it possible to bring in renowned players and commentators alongside fellow VTubers and creators from other communities, with the tournament not only attracting a range of different fanbases, but also creating dream matchups you won’t see anywhere else. The commentary team features a lineup invited by Shishiro Botan personally, including esports commentator Kousuke Hiraiwa, formerly of Asahi Television Broadcasting, along with other experienced commentators and professional players. Not only does their involvement help ensure the tournament’s quality and legitimacy, but their clear commentary and insightful analysis also makes matches easier to follow and understand for viewers who may have never played STREET FIGHTER 6 themselves before or who are unfamiliar with the game altogether.Another unique aspect is the inclusion of open entry slots. For example, when recruiting for the 3rd tournament, applicants needed to meet several criteria: hold a qualifying rank in STREET FIGHTER 6, have prior experience streaming the game, be able to broadcast from their own perspective during the event, and having at least 1,000 channel subscribers. Because of the format of the tournament, participants also had to be able to dedicate up to two full days exclusively for Shishiro Hai. Despite these conditions, there were an impressive 254 applications. One particularly interesting aspect of Shishiro Hai is how the participants were eventually selected – live on Shishiro Botan’s own stream. With so many dedicated fans hoping to see their favorite players chosen, it is only natural that everyone would have different opinions during the selection process, but by making every step of the decision-making process more transparent, Shishiro Botan has been able to turn what could be tense proceedings into something truly entertaining that everyone can share and enjoy together.Above all, what truly sets Shishiro Hai apart is its scale – it is one of the largest tournaments ever hosted by a VTuber. In the next section, we will have a look at data reports as well as the sponsorships and partner collaborations that have made this event possible.Shishiro Hai Achievements and Sponsorship HighlightsShishiro Hai STREET FIGHTER 6 powered by GALLERIAThe very first Shishiro Hai was held on March 31, 2024, with the main stream on Shishiro Botan’s channel reaching a peak of 80,045 concurrent viewers, and including mirror streams, this increased to 190,806. The tournament amazingly had 301,897 unique viewers overall and was trending at #4 on X in Japan.  Sponsors (in no particular order): Gaming PC GALLERIA (THIRDWAVE CORP) / nosh (nosh Inc.) / VICTRIX by PDP (SB C&S Corp.) / Red Bull Japan (Red Bull Japan Co., Ltd.) / GiGO (GENDA GiGO Entertainment Inc.) / esports Challenger’s Park (QTnet, Inc.) / GOKURAKUYU HOLDINGS CO., LTD. / TOKYO DESIGN TECHNOLOGY CENTER / VAXEE (VAXEE) / TSUKUMO (Project White Co., Ltd.)The 2nd Shishiro Hai STREET FIGHTER 6 powered by GALLERIAThe second tournament grew even larger, taking place over two days on October 13-14, 2024. On Day 1, the main broadcast peaked at 56,643 concurrent viewers, reaching 147,402 concurrent viewers when taking mirror streams into account, and 296,410 unique viewers in total. Day 2 attracted an even bigger audience, with the main stream peaking at 72,040 concurrent viewers (150,096 including mirrors) and a total of 305,969 unique viewers. 　Sponsors (in no particular order): Gaming PC GALLERIA (THIRDWAVE CORP) / Red Bull Japan (Red Bull Japan Co., Ltd.）/ elgato / Aishitoto Co., Ltd. / VAXEE (VAXEE) / REALFORCE (Topre Corporation) / PWS JAPAN (Kanematsu PWS LTD.) / esports Challenger’s Park (QTnet,Inc.) / TOKYO DESIGN TECHNOLOGY CENTER / GRAPHT (MSY Inc.) / Yaro Ramen (FOOD REVAMP CO.,LTD.) /  DMM Factory (DMM.com LLC) / nosh (nosh Inc.) The 3rd Shishiro Hai STREET FIGHTER 6 powered by HPThe 3rd Shishiro Hai went up yet another notch, with the tournament on Day 1 featuring a Master Division competition along with an Exhibition Match, followed by Grand Master and Legend Division tournaments on Day 2. This time, the tournament had a slightly more creative format with a unique feature: a cross-divisional progression system. This unique approach, proposed by Shishiro Botan, allowed the winners of the Master and Grand Master Division tournaments to challenge players in the next division up. From the moment it was announced, this system was met with an enthusiastic response from both viewers and participants. In fact, Shibuya HAL, who won the Master Division, and Donpisha, who took first place in the Grand Master Division, both went on to secure impressive victories in the higher divisions as well proving that the cross-divisional progression system not only worked as intended, but was responsible for some unforgettable moments unique to Shishiro Hai. The exhibition match held during the latter half of Day 1 featured a team competition, with two groups of four players facing off against each other for both prizes and to avoid punishments, creating a fun and relaxed atmosphere. The mix of competitive tournaments and casual fun kept things fresh and engaging for beginners and veteran players, ensuring there was always something to enjoy for everyone. Sponsors for the third event were as follows:HP Inc. / Red Bull Japan (Red Bull Japan Co., Ltd.) / GRAPHT (MSY Inc.) / TOKYO DESIGN TECHNOLOGY CENTER / VAXEE (VAXEE) / HUB (HUB CO., LTD.) / JOYPOLIS (CA Sega Joypolis Ltd.) / Turtle Beach (SB C&S Corp.) / Ajinomoto Co., Inc. “あえて、®”There have also been some standout initiatives that have made this event truly special. First, thanks to HP Inc., the main sponsor of the tournament, Shishiro Botan hosted an interactive livestream on her channel ahead of the event where viewers could take part in special missions to unlock the Sponsorship Sale for the 3rd Shishiro Hai, which was successful thanks to everyone’s efforts in completing the challenges. This challenge-based initiative sought to involve the audience more and add to the festival atmosphere surrounding the tournament. During the two days of the main event, public viewings were held at HUBs (UK-style pubs) across Japan, with special Shishiro Hai collaboration drinks also available from May 9 to 25.Right before the tournament, the brand “あえて、®” (pronounced ) from Ajinomoto Co., Inc. was also announced as an official sponsor, but as they had only just launched its own esports initiatives, they contributed by offering their “あえて、®” frozen meal deliveries for the event. During the main event, there was a special segment featuring a fun quiz called  (cooked rice with seasonal ingredients) Blind Challenge that introduced some of the “あえて、®” range and highlighted the uniqueness of the meals in an engaging way. The Value Created by Shishiro HaiWith the support of countless participants and partner companies, Shishiro Hai has evolved into an unprecedentedly influential tournament, opening the door for fans who usually follow VTuber streams to discover the energy and passion of the esports and professional gaming worlds. We even saw the emergence of a few Cinderella stories, with the spotlight shining on certain players in ways they hadn’t experienced before. Above all, everyone involved wants the same thing – to entertain viewers and to have fun themselves: a mindset evident in every part of the event and is one of the reasons Shishiro Hai is continued to be loved by all. Of course, the viewers themselves are an essential part of what makes the tournament so special, but it goes beyond cheering for one’s favorite players in stream chat sections. The excitement and inspiration generated by Shishiro Hai can often be seen as the catalyst for all kinds of new connections and activities with many people joining sponsorship campaigns or discovering new creators to support even after watching their performances at this event.  Stay tuned for the upcoming second and third installments of this special feature, where we interview partners who were on board for Shishiro Hai, the team behind the project, and Shishiro Botan herself who gives us a sneak peek into the collaboration that goes on behind the scenes.* Parts 3 of this article will be published soon.©CAPCOM* All company names, product names, and service names mentioned on this page are trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective companies.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>WATCHALONG the BIG(?)
