After that, I changed to an entertainment company called Tokyo Otaku Mode where I first started working with 2D content and gained experience as a buyer and a licensee as well as managing partners, which is actually the opposite of the role I have now.After I left Tokyo Otaku Mode, I was job hunting when a friend introduced me to COVER. At that time, I had already accepted an offer from another company, but my friend strongly encouraged me to meet with Mr. Tanigo, saying what an interesting person he is and how much I should really talk to him. So I decided to go ahead and meet with him.Back then, I honestly had no intention of joining, and I was pretty skeptical about VTuber culture in general and looking back now, I realize I probably came across as quite dismissive during my conversation with him.¬†Mr. Tanigo shared his strong passion for hololive production and explained his long-term vision in detail when we sat down and talked. He spoke about how genuinely believes more than anyone else in the potential of hololive production and its talents, and he described exactly what he felt was needed to help that potential grow.¬†Hearing his views made me start to feel that maybe I could contribute to this vision as well, and that I wanted to take on the challenge together, which is what ultimately inspired me to join the company.¬†At the time, Mr. Tanigo was actually looking for someone with experience in product planning and development, but during our conversation, he asked me, ‚ÄúHow would you feel about looking after licensing? You‚Äôre great at talking with people, and I have a feeling this could really suit you,‚Äù which led to me being given the opportunity to lead the launch of the licensing business.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>GHOST X GHOST Teams Up with Mori Calliope Again for a PORTRAIT OF DEATH drop! - hololive.hololivepro.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaEFVX3lxTE1WQUE1eTVmZEI0bEt0cVBwT1d4aElzaTFJZWVIQkJPdWxMbl90dnBUX29NS0Q4RmFYT0xkb29HVnp4VGdnR1h3cXhGNllORDJNbzNJeXRKcDJBXzZaN0NycWZmRkRtdDJ5?oc=5</link><author></author><category>hololive</category><pubDate>Thu, 3 Jul 2025 02:41:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.google.com/topics/CAAqKAgKIiJDQkFTRXdvTkwyY3ZNVEZuWDNKc2EyaDRjQklDWlc0b0FBUAE?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;ceid=US:en">hololive on Google News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>hololive English Teams Up with Kura Sushi USA for an Exclusive Summer Collaboration! | COVER Corp. - „Ç´„Éê„ÉºÊ†™Âºè‰ºöÁ§æ</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXkFVX3lxTFB5VV96MVo5SUdaX2VVOEN1dE95aUx4SWJJUGFXMUhvZEhnXy02OEs0R1BZUnljNUxKb0Z1V3VDT0lnVUF3aE4zTWxUd0ZoTF9PT3ZEdERld1FNMjFTb0E?oc=5</link><author></author><category>hololive</category><pubDate>Thu, 3 Jul 2025 01:25:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.google.com/topics/CAAqKAgKIiJDQkFTRXdvTkwyY3ZNVEZuWDNKc2EyaDRjQklDWlc0b0FBUAE?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;ceid=US:en">hololive on Google News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>GHOST X GHOST Teams Up with Mori Calliope Again for a PORTRAIT OF DEATH drop!</title><link>https://hololivepro.com/news_en/20250703-01-175/</link><author>os_pr</author><category>hololive</category><pubDate>Thu, 3 Jul 2025 01:00:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hololivepro.com/">hololive Official News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[July 3, 2025, Tokyo, Japan ‚Äì COVER Corporation (Minato-ku, Tokyo; CEO: Tanigo Motoaki) has announced another collaboration between GHOST X GHOST and Mori Calliope of hololive English of hololive production.

Could you walk us through what led to the decision to incorporate Unreal Engine into this livestream, and how the technology behind your livestream has evolved over time?Thank you very much. Music livestreams for hololive production originally began with the use of motion capture VR equipment. At the time, there were many limitations in terms of hardware and available space, and from a technical standpoint, it was quite difficult to handle longer streams. When it comes to graphics, improvements haven‚Äôt been just one giant leap forward, but rather from steady, incremental progress over time. What‚Äôs particularly worth noting is that this evolution hasn‚Äôt been driven by technology alone ‚Äì it‚Äôs also thanks to the ever-improving skills of our on-site team members who handle lighting and camera work, as well as the increasing expertise of our production staff.As we continued to evolve our production, we still felt there were limitations in our ability to recreate a true sense of presence and immersion to capture the sheer amount of information and realism that a live concert delivers and translate that in a virtual space. While grappling with those challenges, I happened to see the  demo for Unreal Engine 5 released by Unreal Engine, and I was blown away by the sheer volume of detail, making me excited if we were able to use it for our livestreaming. These days, even individual creators are able to produce high quality content using Unreal Engine, so given this shift, we felt it was essential for us as a company to move quickly and begin offering livestreams powered by Unreal Engine as well. That‚Äôs why we made the decision to speed up our timeline and adopt the technology so soon.¬†How has the response to the livestream powered by Unreal Engine been from fans and talents?One of the major reasons we adopted Unreal Engine was to better support our talents ‚Äì to help bring to life performances and expressions they envision. As we gave them progress reports throughout the production process, we could sense their growing excitement ‚Äì a feeling of ‚Äúwe may finally be able to do the things we weren‚Äôt able to before.‚Äù In fact, we‚Äôve already received numerous requests from other talents saying they‚Äôd love to do a livestream using Unreal Engine as well. Being able to provide an environment where we can meet those expectations is incredibly meaningful.¬†¬†The high quality in graphics really surprised and excited fans and talents, even prompting lively discussions on social media, with people speculating about what might be possible with the Unreal Engine. What really stood out among fan reactions was how attentive they were to technical details and how often they would comment on them. We even got comments from those with seemingly quite specialized knowledge noting the incredible use of skeletal mesh for the water effects for instance. It was really encouraging for us to see that level of engagement.¬†Internally, we also treated this as a kind of technical showcase and gave non-engineering staff the opportunity to experience the live environment built with Unreal Engine. It was great to see so many people take interest and participate ‚Äì even those without a technical background.I know we have started using Unreal Engine for music livestreams, but it was originally developed as a game engine. In Japan, what kinds of fields is Unreal Engine currently being used in?In Japan, it has been strongly adopted by television broadcasters in particular. Unreal Engine is highly valued in such environments for its efficiency and speed, qualities that are especially important in the fast-paced world of regular programming and drama production.¬† For example, it‚Äôs been used in a variety of settings, including shoots for NHK‚Äôs historical dramas that use LEDs and commercial network productions, as well as in virtual studios for visual effects work. Recently, stylized expressions () ‚Äì including toon shading () ‚Äì have become increasingly common in the anime production field as well. Unreal Engine is now being used in a wide range of visual and broadcast productions, and the number of projects adopting it continues to grow significantly.Note 1: ‚ÄúStylized‚Äù refers to expressing objects or characters in a unique design or applying a consistent visual styleNote 2: ‚ÄúToon shading‚Äù is a technique used to make 3DCG look like hand-drawn illustrations or cel-style animation.In television and other video production on-site, deadlines tend to be very tight, and in the past, there were only a limited number of iterations () possible. But with real-time rendering, teams can now immediately check the results of their work, making it possible to produce higher-quality content more efficiently. The video industry has long made use of dedicated software and middleware, but the biggest advantage of Unreal Engine is that it provides an environment where high-quality visuals can be created in real time. In addition to Unreal Engine itself, we also provide an ecosystem that includes assets like Megascans (), allowing even small teams to produce high-quality content.Note 3: Iteration refers to a development cycle often used in software development and project management, where design development and testing are repeated in short intervalsNote 4: Megascans is a high-quality 3D asset scans library offered by Quixel. It features physically-based rendering with faithfully captured high-resolution details. These assets can be directly exported into Unreal Engine.In fields like video and anime production, Unreal Engine can dramatically streamline the traditional workflow. In fact, directors or supervisors can even build scenes directly in the editor without needing a storyboard. The ability for users to work in a pipeline that closely resembles real-world production has significantly improved trial-and-error speeds ‚Äì something that many professionals have found especially valuable.Blending Photorealism and Anime: Engineers‚Äô Innovative Approach to Unreal EngineThis was your first time implementing Unreal Engine, but could you tell us about the technical challenges you faced and any creative solutions you came up with when using it for your livestream?For this project, I oversaw development direction, and the biggest benefit we saw from adopting Unreal Engine were in the lighting quality and the overall production speed. The lighting design was completed in just a few weeks, which is an incredibly fast turnaround, and the final visual output far exceeded our expectations in terms of expression. Although, bringing together the photorealistic visuals that Unreal Engine excels at with the anime likeness of the hololive talents into the same space did require a great deal of technical ingenuity.¬†¬†I was in charge of graphics, and the most challenging part for me was finding the right balance between a sense of realism and an anime-style aesthetic that would look visually appealing in a video. We put a lot of effort into blending the talents naturally into the environment, especially in how they interacted with the background, by implementing a ‚Äúholo-color grading system‚Äù and creating a custom post-effect volume, separate from Unreal Engine‚Äôs standard post-effects. This setup allowed us to apply grading () separately to the talents and the background, and then apply master grading on top of both. It also allowed us to separately adjust the color grading of the talents and the background based on parameters like the time of day and weather changes as well as made it possible to naturally blend the stylized talents into a photorealistic background.¬†Note 5: ‚ÄúGrading‚Äù refers to the process of adjusting colors, tones and contrast in a video to create a particular atmosphere or visual world.We also had to get creative with Lumen, Unreal Engine‚Äôs global illumination system. Using the default Lumen settings made the talents appear overly three-dimensional ‚Äì almost like figurines ‚Äì so we adjusted the lighting to tone down that sense of depth while still retaining the ambient lighting of the environment.¬†I contributed to the project mainly by modifying the engine including developing existing character shaders and implementing post-effects. One of the key challenges was figuring out how to faithfully translate our existing character expressions into Unreal Engine. That simply wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without making modifications to the engine. Because Unreal Engine‚Äôs G-buffer couldn‚Äôt fully accommodate the range of expressions we needed, we implemented a few workarounds including quantizing and compressing the data, and extending the system to allow constant buffers to be added per material.In environments with such a large number of lights active at once, the standard lighting caused the cel-shaded appearance talents to break up a bit. To address this, we implemented a custom lighting system specially for those talents and thanks to this, we were able to maintain consistent anime-style shading even in scenes with more than 50 real-time light sources.We also addressed translucency by rendering the relevant materials in a separate buffer using multipass rendering, which allowed us to have deferred lighting for translucent materials.¬†: G-buffers store geometric information about objects in a scene, such as normal vectors, albedo (surface color) and depth information. By using a G-buffer, rendering performance can be improved, and more complex lighting calculations can be performed efficiently.¬†‚ñºExpressions that use over 50 light sources in real timeI am in charge of talent-related development, focusing on ways to introduce outlines into talent expressions.There are two ways of doing this, either with push or post outlines, and we have to make detailed adjustments so that we can switch between the two as necessary depending on how close the camera is. During the live performance, as a production changes from evening to night as time elapses, we adjusted the color grading in real time using Sequencer () for each time period, so that the talents‚Äô movements appear natural. For normal vectors, we originally used SDF textures to control the shading, but this didn‚Äôt suit environments with multiple lights and some appearances ended up being less than ideal, so instead of using SDF textures (), we switched to controlling it with vertex normal, which produced far more beautiful shadows.¬†Note 7: Sequencer is an editor for creating cut scenes. A series of scenes can be created by putting cameras and characters onto a timeline.Note 8: A type of texture for 3D shapes that uses SDFs (Signed Distance Fields), which can make shape outlines look very smooth by saving the space between an object‚Äôs position and a shape, and stronger textures for objects that enlarge/shrink and animations.SDF textures are effective when there is one source of light, but when multiple light sources hit an object, we get bands that we don‚Äôt want. For example, when there is an overlap of SDF textures from light that hits from both the left and right, unnatural 2D bands appear creating an unintentional anime likeness. Therefore, we reverted back to a method of editing vertex normals like those used in fighting video games where anime-like characters appear, which we thought made sense for environments with multiple light sources.¬†Also, similar to live music concerts, there were camera exposure issues, where talents are too bright when a spotlight, like a real camera at a concert, hits them, or too dark when the exposure is adjusted.¬†In order to address such issues, we introduced a system that corrects exposure for each camera using a MIDI controller. We needed to calculate outline extrusion to align with camera angles, because live cameras use 200mm or 300mm telephoto lens settings.¬†We use the Live Link plugin () with our cameras, but this time, we also used the FreeD protocol ( to link our Panasonic camera remotes so we could control the virtual cameras to make it feel like an actual live broadcast, and thanks to our staff, some of whom have knowledge in the TV field, we were able to create a workflow not too dissimilar to that of one. Certain staff members commented that although we are using Unreal Engine, what we are doing is no different from filming in reality, so it turned out to be a good example of combining technology from staff who originally worked in TV and Unreal Engine.¬†Note 9: An Unreal Engine plugin for streaming data to Unreal Engine from external software and devices in real time. It can provide a basis for sharing information in real time such as animation data and camera movements.¬†Note 10: A communication standard for directly transmitting camera tracking information (pan, tilt, zoom, etc.) to a control system in order to coordinate camera movements with computer graphics content.We feel that there is an extremely high capacity to accommodate livestream concepts and talents‚Äô wishes since using Unreal Engine to continue to develop our content. Original concepts, such as weather changes and the elapsing of time, can be implemented with an exceptionally high level of quality, and it has contributed to improved realism and elevated our livestreams, through such lighting improvements and by being able to have interactive expressions such as water bouncing off of the bodies of talents, or rain streaming down faces.¬†That‚Äôs great. It seems like there are various ways to create anime likenesses from a system optimized for photorealism. What measures did you have in place to optimize frame rate and lag, also vitally important for livestreams?Our biggest issue was using over 50 light sources once activating ray tracing . First of all, we thoroughly managed channels such as light that did or did not cast a shadow or those that cast light. Also, we used and optimized Variable Rate Shading (VRS) , as a high amount of translucent light puts a lot of stress on the system. Originally, we also wanted to use VRS as it‚Äôs adaptive, but we set a constant unit due to time restrictions. In spite of this, we still got 2 to 3 times more speed.We greatly customized DMX (Note 13) light shaft calculations and implemented measures such as reducing the number of steps for ray marching (Note 14), and also optimized packaging. By minimizing the dependency, packaging that has usually taken about an hour was done in roughly 5-10 mins ‚Äì iteration speed improvements were hugely important from a development efficiency standpoint.¬†Note 11: A kind of technology that generates real images by simulating the volume, angle, refraction, and reflection of the rays of light via a computer. This is used to accurately represent the reflection, refraction and shadowing of light.Note 12: Variable Rate Shading (VRS) is a type of rendering technology for improving performance and picture quality in game development that allows for pixel shading rates (frequency of processing one pixel) to be actively adjusted to reduce the load when processing images. Note 13: DMX (Digital Multiplex) is a digital transmission network that is used to control stage lighting and effects for concerts and events, from the more simple to complicated ones.¬†Note 14: A kind of rendering technique in the ray tracing field.We were doing a lot of customization within Unreal Engine, such as compressing values to 4 bit to preserve the G-buffer, and packing multiple parameters into single channels. Also, to handle translucent areas, we increased deferred rendering (deferred shading) , and increased speed making use of stencil masking. We are also steadily optimizing how we deal with divergent branches in the Shader.CPU optimization was also important. In particular, we greatly improved the performance of the editor while in use by introducing C++ to DMX plugin blueprint processes. In the future, we would like to continue this optimization to make both real-time editing using the editor and use in livestreams possible together. In terms of motion capture, we are using COVER‚Äôs original system, and we also developed an original system for integrating data from Vicon () to Motion Builder , and then to Unreal Engine.¬†We could also use Live Link for motion capture as well, but we needed a multi-engine approach because we were developing with both Unreal Engine and Unity (). As well as this, we are developing our own system that takes into account redundancy support and transmission load distribution, so that issues never occur during livestreams.Note 15: A type of 3D computer graphics rendering technique where complex light can be effectively expressed in real time. Note 16: The name of a motion capture systemNote 17: The name of a real-time 3D character animation softwareNote 18: The game engine developed by Unity TechnologiesVery interesting. Thank you very much. I‚Äôm extremely interested in this example of actual camera operators and lighting staff directly controlling Unreal Engine rather than engineers.Traditionally, we have needed to allow time to transfer what we designed using the lighting simulation software to the game engine, but this time, we had lighting experts set fixtures () and patch () these designs directly into Unreal Engine. This new trend of having professional lighting staff use the game engine felt really revolutionary.¬†(Note 19) Lighting equipment that use and are controlled by DMX protocols(Note 20) Making partial revision and changesThe Importance of a Multitude of Skills and a Support Network: Strengths and Prospects of Development Using Unreal EngineWhat advantages and/or costs have you felt there have been by introducing Unreal Engine and how has this affected the organization?The speed from production to implementation has been so helpful! Unreal Engine is full of high quality features meaning that even non-engineers can help in the development process, so it took just weeks after we had the concept of the concert to finish the stage prototype.We were able to take a balanced approach over a 7-8 month period for this concert production, by recompiling the engine where necessary while taking full advantage of Unreal Engine‚Äôs existing functions, such as the DMX plugin. Unreal Engine is super flexible, being able to handle a variety of different situations, so high quality content can be made in quick time for short-term projects without recompiling the engine, and for large-scale projects, one of the advantages is that our own expressions can be tracked by modifying the source code.There was a mix of staff on this production from a wide range of industries, including gaming, TV, and mobile, and everyone‚Äôs skills seemed to fit the project well. However, what kinds of skillsets do Epic Games expect people to have and are required when using Unreal Engine?¬†I deal with a lot of different customers in technical support, but regardless of the industry you are in, it is extremely important to be fully across the concept of real-time rendering. We are coming up with a number of ways to draw frames in such short 16-millisecond amounts of time for the gaming industry, so understanding what can be done under real-time restrictions is so crucial when using Unreal Engine. Sometimes people used to more conventional forms of offline rendering suddenly start using Unreal Engine and are surprised by how restricted they feel. Having gaming industry graphics professionals such as yourself (Okugawa) is such a huge asset to COVER.¬†¬†Oh, and one more thing: when working on livestreams, it is necessary to have multiple instances of Unreal Engine and have them in sync. Within Unreal Engine, there is a range of tools from those on the network level to synchronizing monitors, but you also need the knowledge to understand what is causing any problems that arise.¬†¬†¬†It definitely seems that you need a strong mix of people in an engineering team with a diverse set of skills from fields ranging from gaming to film for the production side of livestreams. Could you please tell us about what kind of support you, at Epic Games, provide Unreal Engine users?We have our official Epic Pro Support subscription add-on, as well as our Epic Developer Community forums where users help each other and exchange information. With Epic Pro Support, we provide support for those with highly technical issues and supply the latest information, as well as sharing know-how about profiling and optimization from what we actually do on-site. Our team mainly provides community support: we have recently started sharing Q&As we have received through our pro support subscription with our Epic Developer Community, after removing any confidential information, giving a whole lot of developers access to quality information.Behind this initiative to share Q&A with the public are the strong intentions from our founder (of Epic Games), Tim Sweeney. Tim himself began his career in game development with just a single computer, and truly wishes to support all those, from indie games developers to students, aiming to be creators, at Epic Games are striving to create an environment where creators can grow and develop.¬†Also, there are passionate fans of Unreal Engine everywhere organizing their own independent community events, to which we at Epic Games actively try to attend. There are Unreal Engine enthusiasts not only in Tokyo, Osaka and Fukuoka, but in a lot of different places with a real energy to excite the community around them. We really value these fans and want to support them as best we can.¬†Evolving Technology for a New Future:COVER and Epic Games Redefining Expressions and Entertainment with Unreal EngineCould you tell us what plans Epic Games has for the future and the direction the development of Unreal Engine is heading?We are currently envisioning a dual-axis approach to the development of Unreal Engine at the moment: the vertical evolution of quality along with the horizontal expansion of the platform and its userbase. One of the big themes for Epic Games as a whole is the strengthening of our support for mobile platforms, and optimization so that we can provide high-quality content to a wider range of devices.¬†¬†Also, our metaverse vision is also strategically important for us. Our global expansion through Fortnite is a great representation of this, with Unreal Engine at the heart of its technical infrastructure. We are focusing a lot on UGC (user-generated content) through our UEFN (Unreal Editor for Fortnite), and creating an environment where not only engineers but regular users can also produce their own content.From a technological perspective, as well as improvements in graphics, we believe that movement and motion expressions are becoming an important topic. We (at Epic Games) have a comprehensive service where people can create a realistic human called MetaHuman, and we have recently added a function called MetaHuman Animator where, just by filming your own expressions using an iPhone, you can transfer these movements to MetaHuman. At the moment, we are focusing on developing the realism of digital humans, but we also plan to expand this so that this technology can be applied to various talents and other expressions. By further improving the real-time nature of it, we expect that even more natural and interactive expressions will be possible.The use of the fully immersive display Sphere in Las Vegas has also received quite a lot of attention recently. In most cases, a video that has been previously rendered is projected onto a screen, but more and more cases of projections in real-time using Unreal Engine are emerging. For example, the spherical screen of Sphere was used at a live concert for the band Phish in the US, who are known for their improvisation, to project graphics in real-time using Unreal Engine to match their performance. A Fortnite event in New York also had multiple screens around Times Square that were being controlled simultaneously and linked to artists‚Äô performances.¬†We hope to use Unreal Engine for more of these kinds of immersive experiences within Japan as well. Unreal Fest 2025 Tokyo is planned for November 14 and 15 of this year in Takanawa, Tokyo, where all the latest use cases of Unreal Engine in various industries and information on the technology will be shared over the 2 days on an even bigger scale than last year, so we hope you can join us if you are interested.What challenges would COVER like to undertake using Unreal Engine in the future?We would like to further improve the quality of our livestreams, and for not only that, but for a range of other events as well. For instance, every summer, hololive holds a swimsuit event and with Unreal Engine, it may even be possible to have talents swimming underwater as an example. We also hope to increase our AR (augmented reality) content combining both real-life and animation together, and with how compatible it is with real-time lighting, we also have our sights on developing our on-location content and TV programs too.¬†¬†¬†¬†We are also considering content that features more interactivity with fans, taking advantage of its unique features as a game engine. At COVER, we are also developing a metaverse, so we hope to use Unreal Engine to develop content in the 3D space, and not just video streams.¬†We can see from this chat that a range of experts are now taking on the challenge of blending the seemingly contradictory elements of realism and animated expression. The similarities of both Epic Games and COVER, who are supporting creators through technological development as well as talents and their aspirations, opens up a whole new world of possibilities for VTuber entertainment.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>We Held Our Third All- Employee Meeting and Announced the COVER AWARD 2024 Winners</title><link>https://coveredge.cover-corp.com/en/list/2275</link><author>Âπ≥ÊùæÊ¢®Ê≤ô</author><category>COVER</category><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 02:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://coveredge.cover-corp.com/en">COVEREdge Magazine</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On May 27, 2025, we held our third COVER Corporation All-Employee Meeting with over 700 employees in attendance, and included opening remarks from the directors, the announcement of the COVER AWARD 2024, a group photo session, and a casual networking reception.

A New Fan Experience Full of Original Illustrations and Unique Content.The store, which will be available until spring 2026, is expected to be a new transmission hub for VTuber culture right on Tokyo‚Äôs doorstep, a destination for domestic and international tourists.One of the unique features of this shop is the original merchandise that changes depending on the time of year. For example, in December 2024, a range of products featuring hololive production talents in hololive Station Costumes designed by illustrator Hiragi to look like station attendants were released, including acrylic stands and name tag-style acrylic badges, which received a lot of support from fans. Inside the shop, one can hear exclusive in-store announcements recorded by the talents, and find handwritten signatures and comments from talents scattered all over the shop, creating a station-like atmosphere and bringing together all sorts of people. *Announcements will change at different times of the year.Unique initiatives can also be taken on, as the store can be easily adapted to suit requests from talents. Special campaigns or projects are implemented to coincide with a talent‚Äôs live concert or an album release, which talents in turn have brought up during their livestreams. Fans can look forward to different projects and campaigns throughout the year, with new themed merchandise releases and announcements whenever they visit the store.Best-Sellers and Creating Unique, Valued Experiences Through Offline StoresWhen asked what products are the most prolific sellers, KIDDY LAND‚Äôs Kaneaki Kubushiro, the shop manager, said that the station attendant uniform series of original merchandise and confectionery has been particularly popular.‚ÄúWe consistently sell 5-10 units of confectionery featuring the talents in their hololive Station Costumes every hour, with certain customers buying the maximum amount they can for restricted merchandise‚Äù he said, talking about the high demand for souvenirs taking full advantage of the prime location that is Tokyo Station.hololive Station Costume acrylic stands are also strong sellers, with many fans coming to the store in search of their oshi‚Äôs design, a highly valued piece of memorabilia.He spoke about their popularity as these merchandise are easily portable for fans‚Äô : ‚ÄúThe plushies and mascots have also been well-received because their design is perfect for daily use: they are a good size for fans to store in or decorate their bags with, so they can have one or more with them all the time. We get many customers who buy plushies of their oshi in bulk, so sales rival those of the hololive Station series.‚ÄùThe shop offers different experience value for fans, who have mainly shopped online, in physically coming to the store and actually holding the products in their hands before choosing their purchases.‚ÄúI was thrilled to be able to see and choose my oshi‚Äôs plushies in person to see how big they were in actuality and how they felt,‚Äù said a male Sakura Miko fan hailing from Chiba Prefecture, who visited the store for the first time: a visit that coincided with a cheer screening in Shinagawa, Tokyo.Another male customer, who had been to the shop about 3 or 4 times to support Kazama Iroha,¬† places importance on the value of collector‚Äôs items, elaborating on his specific reason for being at the shop: ‚ÄúBecause my oshi, Kazama Iroha, ends her sentences with ‚Äú„Åî„Åñ„Çã‚Äù (), there is the wordplay ‚Äú„Åî„Åñ„Çã„ÅÆ5‚Äù (), and so I want to collect 5 (‚Äú‚Äù in Japanese) of her plushies. I already have one at home, so I bought four more.‚Äù¬†Kubushiro also talked about how popular the handwritten signature displays were, as fans can only see them because there is a physical store: ‚ÄúThese are also extremely popular. Photos [of these displays] actively get circulated around social media because almost everyone who comes to the shop wants to take a picture of them, and we even get a lot of people asking us where their oshi‚Äôs signature is. These signature displays are valuable because the talents actually came to sign them in person, so you can only see them here, which has pleased a lot of customers over the first month since opening.‚ÄùThe shop is a new point of contact between fans and talents, offering special experiences that one cannot get online. It contributes to further stimulating the fan community, where there is tremendous value in ‚Äúreal‚Äù elements at a physical shop like this in a landscape where the digital medium is the main battleground for VTubers.‚ÄúWhat has particularly left an impression on me is seeing customers lining up patiently while holding a suitcase or a huge backpack. Despite having such heavy luggage with them, many customers come ‚Äòonly wanting to buy one item.‚Äô The crowds get really lively when there‚Äôs an ongoing campaign or event,‚Äù said Kubushiro, also mentioning that there are often lines of up to 50 people outside the shop before and after live events.¬†The Global Expansion of VTuber Culture and hololive production from the Perspective of a Diverse FanbaseWhen asked who makes up the main clientele at the shop, Kubushiro responded, ‚ÄúAbout 70-80% are male, with about 20-30% from overseas. In particular, we get more customers from Asia, but on holidays we get westerners coming in as well.‚Äù He also mentioned that tax-free purchases can be made as part of the shop‚Äôs efforts to appeal to incoming tourists.We asked a female customer, who was visiting the store to get a Fuwawa Abyssgard random card and had visited about three times so far, about her impressions of the shop: ‚ÄúThere are a lot of overseas visitors here early in the morning on weekdays.‚ÄùWhen looking at customer trends a little deeper, we can see that VTubers are supported by many age groups, with many families also visiting the shop. We spoke to a family who were at the shop with their 10-year-old son, a Sakura Miko fan, about how they became fans of hololive: ‚ÄúWe originally started out watching game livestreams, which is how we first heard about VTubers. It was because there were some VTubers among these video game streamers that we started enjoying VTuber videos as a family.‚ÄùWe also asked an elementary schoolgirl, a fan of Hoshimachi Suisei, making the most of her winter vacation and visiting the shop with her family from Kawasaki about how she came to know about hololive: ‚ÄúI became a fan after hearing her sing on YouTube, and now I support her wholeheartedly.‚ÄùA male fan in his 40s, visiting the shop to buy Tokoyami Towa merchandise for his colleague, talked about music content as the gateway for new fans: ‚ÄúI am stopping in on the way to a jazz concert. I am a big music lover, and first learned about VTubers through Hoshimachi Suisei‚Äôs appearance on THE FIRST TAKE, and from then on I was a fan. I am planning on getting Hoshimachi Suisei‚Äôs upcoming LP.‚ÄùA Hub for Fans Across the Globe. An Offline Store Opening Doors to New Possibilities.Store manager Kubushiro, based on what he has witnessed in Tokyo, spoke about the shop‚Äôs prospects: ‚ÄúWe will continue to manage this shop by prioritizing the special feelings people get when buying a particular product, or looking forward to seeing something at the shop. I hope to be able to continue developing this store, making full use of the space here at Tokyo Station for 1, 2, even 3 years to come, and based on the success we‚Äôve had here at Tokyo Station, expand to have more locations all over Japan.‚ÄùFor instance, he envisions a future with an Osaka store that fans can visit whenever a concert is held there.¬†COVER President Tanigo still has the vision he has had since the company‚Äôs inception of ‚Äúwanting to create a company that breaks through onto the global stage with Japanese entertainment,‚Äù and continues to pour all of his effort into making people more aware of VTubers both within Japan and on a global scale. Establishing a hololive production Official Shop in such an international location like Tokyo Station, where an abundance of overseas tourists can also easily visit the store, is an excellent opportunity for, not only domestic fans, but fans and tourists from all over the world to experience VTuber culture, and a step towards being able to share VTuber culture with so many more people.¬†¬†There will be a lot of interest in what sort of possibilities this new hub on Tokyo‚Äôs doorstep can bring to the future development of VTuber culture, as a space for experiencing the world of hololive production and a place where fans from all over the world can gather.*This article is based on interviews conducted on December 28, 2024, and may differ from current information.First Store in West Japan! hololive production official shop in Osaka Umeda Opening Soon!Shop Name: hololive production official shop in Osaka UmedaLocation: B1F North Building, Hankyu Sanban Gai, 1-1-3 Shibata, Kita-ku, OsakaDates: June 27, 2025 ‚Äì Spring 2026Opening Hours:¬† 10:00 AM ‚Äì 9:00 PM (JST)*Opening hours will follow HANKYU SANBAN GAI hours of business.https://hololive.hololivepro.com/en/events/shopumeda/]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tuesday, June 17 at 6:16 PM EDT</title><link>https://warosu.org/vt/thread/101309741</link><author></author><category>/vt/ /news/</category><category>VTubers</category><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 22:16:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://vt.rita.moe/">/vt//news/</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Identify and Avoid Black Companies in the VTuber Industry</title><link>https://vtubersensei.com/2025/06/17/how-to-identify-and-avoid-black-companies-in-the-vtuber-industry/</link><author>Thomas Toblu</author><category>VTubers</category><enclosure url="https://vtubersensei.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/former-hololive-talent-kiryu-coco.jpg?w=640" length="" type="text/html"/><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 11:43:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://vtubersensei.com/">VTuber Sensei</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A ‚ÄúBlack Company‚Äù („Éñ„É©„ÉÉ„ÇØ‰ºÅÊ•≠, burakku kigy≈ç) is a Japanese term for an exploitative, sweatshop-style employer that forces excessive unpaid work and mistreats employees. In Japan this commonly means young workers required to work brutal overtime without extra pay, subjected to verbal abuse and ‚Äúpower harassment‚Äù from bosses. VTuber agencies worldwide have been likened to black companies when they impose similar conditions on talent. Agencies promise stardom but may demand long hours, strict obedience, and ambiguous contracts. This can be especially dangerous for female VTubers, who may face added pressures or harassment. In this context,  warning signs of an exploitative VTuber company and knowing how to protect yourself are crucial.Originally coined in Japan, a black company is one that exploits staff much like a sweatshop: hiring young or inexperienced workers and forcing them to work excessive overtime without pay, often under bullying or harassing supervisors. Employees who try to quit can be threatened with humiliation or litigation. By extension, VTuber agencies that treat their performers as disposable labor ‚Äì imposing grueling schedules, unclear rules, or punishing talent for speaking up ‚Äì are sometimes called black companies by fans and insiders. These agencies may exploit the  of entertainers, offering fame in exchange for unreasonable demands. For example, some VTuber contracts bind talent  to the agency: ‚Äúthe talent will exclusively perform entertainment activities for the ‚Ä¶ agency‚Äù in return for support. A healthy agency might also bind talent to themselves, but black agencies use exclusivity to prevent talent from leaving or working elsewhere even when conditions deteriorate.Globally, fans and VTubers have grown wary of agencies with these traits. Media reports have noted VTuber companies coming under fire for ‚Äúabrupt graduations, terminations, and suggestions that the company has stymied its talent‚Äôs attempts at potential growth opportunities‚Äù. In other words, when agencies suddenly cut ties with popular performers or block them from succeeding independently, supporters cry ‚Äúblack company.‚Äù Paying attention to how an agency treats its current talent is key to spotting trouble.One stark example involves , a popular Nijisanji EN VTuber. In Feb 2024, Nijisanji  Selen‚Äôs contract without warning  All her social accounts were immediately locked and her videos removed ‚Äì far from the mutual ‚Äúgraduation‚Äù that is normal in VTuber culture. Only later did details emerge: Selen had been hospitalized for ‚Äúpoor management and a toxic work environment‚Äù at the agency. This incident sparked an unprecedented public outcry and even saw corporate sponsors dropping ties in solidarity.Another case was  (Nijisanji EN), who was fired in March 2023 over alleged copyright and ‚Äúoffensive‚Äù remarks. Nijisanji claimed she violated rules, but Zaion‚Äôs supporters pointed out inconsistencies and possible misunderstandings. In both the Selen and Zaion incidents, critics noted that Nijisanji‚Äôs handling was abrupt and opaque, with no chance for talent to defend themselves. Such incidents became rallying cries: fans observed that talents were even ‚Äúpaying out of pocket for assets and materials‚Äù because the company refused to cover basic expenses. (In fact, Selen had to fund a fan-art contest prize herself when Nijisanji insisted the money come from the VTuber‚Äôs personal funds.) These stories are symptomatic of black company behavior in VTubing: shifting blame onto the talent, demanding free labor, and terminating contracts unilaterally.Other VTuber agencies have faced criticism. New international groups like VReverie were even labeled  by former affiliates on social media. While details vary, the pattern is similar: former talents describe ‚Äútoxic work environments,‚Äù withheld payments, or harassment by management. Whenever an agency consistently mistreats talent with no accountability, veteran VTubers warn others to beware.Challenges Unique to Female VTubersFemale VTubers can face additional risks in exploitative settings. In many cultures, women entertainers are subject to stricter expectations and more intense scrutiny. VTubers (virtual YouTubers) are no exception. Female talents often attract ‚Äúparasocial‚Äù fan attachments ‚Äì fans who feel a personal, emotional connection to the streamer. While a lot of parasocial support is positive, some of it can become dangerous. In practice, this means female VTubers are more likely to be harassed online, doxxed, or have false rumors spread. Management may do little to protect them, or worse, pressure them to cater to overzealous haters (sometimes calling it ).Parasocial Relationships in VTubing Explained (a female VTuber) was suspended in 2020 after intense online backlash: she had simply mentioned Taiwan on-stream and was flooded by nationalist harassment, leading her agency to suspend her despite her innocence. This illustrates how quickly a female VTuber‚Äôs career can be derailed by fan attacks and agency panic.Legally, female VTubers in virtual workplaces have the same rights as in any job. Experts emphasize that harassment via an avatar or chat is still harassment. For instance, U.S. labor lawyers point out that ‚Äúthe absence of actual touching is immaterial‚Ä¶ [Harassing] verbal comments based on sex in an employment context is unlawful‚Äù, even in virtual settings This means an agency is responsible if a talent faces gender-based harassment, cyberbullying, or worse (and can be liable if it doesn‚Äôt address it). Unfortunately, some VTuber companies have been slow to implement clear anti-harassment policies. Female VTubers may also encounter pressure to adopt certain ‚Äúcute‚Äù or sexualized personas; if an agency uses coercion or unfair expectations in this regard, that is another red flag.In summary, female VTubers must navigate both the general risks of a black-agency environment  gendered pressures. They may need stronger support networks (fellow VTubers, unions, legal advisors) to ensure they aren‚Äôt exploited or silenced.Red Flags and Warning Signs of an Exploitative VTuber AgencyVague or Missing Contract: No clear, written contract (or one packed with unclear terms) is a major red flag. Legitimate agencies will provide a professional talent contract. Be especially cautious of agreements that never specify pay, scope of work, or duration, or that can be terminated on a whim. (For reference, a typical VTuber ‚Äútalent exclusive contract‚Äù should at least state that the talent performs exclusively for the agency, and outline mutual obligations.) Being asked to work ‚Äúfor exposure‚Äù is a classic exploitative tactic. Agencies forcing long hours of streaming, content creation, or fan service without overtime pay are using black-company tactics. Watch out if you‚Äôre routinely working late nights or weekends beyond any agreed schedule, or if they require you to skip breaks or sleep in the office/studio.Verbal Abuse or Harassment: Any bullying by managers, producers, or staff is unacceptable. Black companies often use ‚Äúpower harassment‚Äù to control employees. If agency staff or supervisors frequently belittle talents, issue ultimatums, or pressure you relentlessly, take it very seriously. Agencies should clearly explain how and when you‚Äôll be paid (salary vs. revenue share vs. commissions). Beware if payment terms are never discussed or if money disappears mysteriously. Delayed or withheld earnings, unexplained ‚Äúcommissions,‚Äù or being told ‚Äúyou‚Äôll see it eventually‚Äù are strong warning signs. (For example, Nijisanji reportedly blamed Selen for ‚Äúdelays in payment,‚Äù but artists she worked with confirmed she  paid them out of pocket ‚Äì suggesting the blame was misdirection.)Ownership of Your Persona and Content: Many agencies claim ownership of the VTuber character or exclusive rights to your name and likeness. A one-sided clause that gives the company total control over your character design, brand, or even videos can be problematic. Legitimate contracts may license your character for agency use, but red flags include clauses that forbid you ever using your own avatar or name outside the company, even after you leave.Strict Exclusivity or Long Lock-in: If the agency demands an unusually long exclusive term (several years) with onerous penalties for early exit, be wary. Standard talent contracts often last 1‚Äì2 years with renewal options; anything much longer may be designed to trap you.Exploitive Auditions or Fees: Sometimes black agencies charge ‚Äúmanagement fees‚Äù up front or require you to pay for training, costumes, or equipment that should be provided. Legitimate agencies may require standard fees or deposits, but watch out if costs keep mounting or aren‚Äôt clearly justified.Sudden Termination or Blacklisting: A hallmark of a bad agency is firing talent without notice or mutual agreement. Nijisanji‚Äôs treatment of Selen ‚Äì removing her from the roster  and locking her accounts overnight ‚Äì is an extreme example. If an agency has a history of ‚Äúgraduating‚Äù or dropping VTubers abruptly (especially with public accusations or deleted content), that indicates low job security.Punishing Whistleblowers: If current or former talents speaking up about poor conditions are ostracized, threatened with NDAs, or prevented from leaving, consider that a warning. Black companies often try to silence complaints through legal threats or social pressure.Poor Reputation or Insider Reports: When researching an agency, pay attention to community chatter. If multiple VTubers or staff privately say the environment is abusive, believe it. Likewise, if the company is secretive about contract terms or refuses to put promises in writing, exercise caution.Any one of these signs doesn‚Äôt guarantee a company is exploitative, but several together strongly suggest trouble. Always trust your instincts: if something  off (like management making impossible demands or colleagues disappearing suddenly), take it seriously.If You‚Äôre Under Contract: Rights and Safety MeasuresIf you find yourself already working for a problematic agency, there are steps you can take to protect yourself:Know Your Contract and Rights: Carefully read your contract. In most places, a written employment or talent contract is legally binding; if you signed nothing, the agreement may be unenforceable. Check for exit clauses: does the contract specify a notice period, buyout options, or conditions for termination? Consult local labor laws: in many countries, forcing unpaid overtime or withholding wages violates employment law. If possible, seek legal advice from an attorney experienced in entertainment or labor law (some firms specialize in VTuber issues). Keep meticulous records of all mistreatment or contract breaches. Note dates, times, and details whenever you are asked to work beyond agreed hours, or subjected to harassment or unfair terms. Save copies of emails, messages, and any social media posts related to your work. Take screenshots of chat logs and keep them secure. This evidence can be vital if you need to prove your case to authorities or negotiate an exit.Follow Internal Procedures (If Any): If the company has a harassment or grievance policy, use it. Some contracts or handbooks outline a process for complaints. File written reports with HR or designated contacts, keeping your own copies. Even if you suspect management won‚Äôt act, having formally complained shows you raised concerns in good faith.Seek External Advice and Support: Look for unions or associations that represent entertainers in your region. For example, actors‚Äô unions (like SAG-AFTRA in the U.S., Equity in the U.K., or the Japanese ) may offer guidance to performers. If no specific union exists, legal aid societies or labor rights groups can sometimes help with contract disputes. Peers in the VTuber community can also advise or refer you to reputable lawyers. Don‚Äôt underestimate reaching out to a lawyer even for a consultation; specialized entertainment attorneys exist and may work on a sliding scale. If you experience sexual harassment, threats, or stalking, treat it like any other workplace violence: inform the agency (preferably in writing) and consider contacting local law enforcement or advocacy groups. The virtual nature of VTubing doesn‚Äôt remove real-world protections: for instance, U.S. law recognizes that unwanted sexual comments or virtual touching of an avatar can count as harassment. If you fear for your physical safety or mental health, seek help immediately (hotlines, police, or medical professionals as needed). If the situation is intolerable, plan a safe way out. Review your contract for termination clauses. If there‚Äôs a required notice period, see if you can negotiate a shorter end or a buyout. Do  simply vanish; abrupt disappearance could breach contract terms and give the company legal ammunition. Instead, consider a formal resignation letter (or request for contract termination) and try to negotiate the terms (perhaps with the aid of a lawyer). Be cautious about making public accusations before you have secured an exit, as this can provoke threats of litigation. If possible, line up next steps first: for example, negotiate with the agency to let you keep your avatar or content rights when you leave, or have a friend or family member ready to take over tasks during your transition.Prioritize Mental Health: Working for an abusive company can be stressful. Make sure to lean on friends, family, or professional counselors for emotional support. Talk with other VTubers who have left agencies or who faced similar struggles; peer support can be invaluable. Remember that no job is worth sacrificing your well-being.Throughout this process, keep in mind your basic labor rights: in many countries, withholding agreed pay, forcing illegal contracts, or subjecting someone to a hostile work environment is against the law. Government labor offices often handle wage complaints even for creative industries. Documenting all issues and seeking legal counsel will strengthen your position if you must fight a very bad contract.Choosing a Safe Agency or Going IndependentPros and Cons of joining a VTuber AgencyTo prevent these problems in the first place, female VTubers should be very careful in selecting representation. Consider these strategies:Research the Agency Thoroughly: Before auditioning or signing, dig into the agency‚Äôs reputation. Look for news articles, forum discussions, or social media about the company. Have any former talents spoken out? How did the agency handle past controversies? An agency with transparent policies and few scandals is safer.Interview Current Talent: If possible, talk privately with current or recent VTubers at the agency. Ask about working conditions, management style, and whether they feel supported. Even just observing these streamers and their content can give clues: do they seem happy and well-resourced, or burnt out and secretive?Review the Contract in Detail: Don‚Äôt sign sight-unseen. Ask for the full contract up front and read every clause. Check for things like: payment terms (when and how you get paid), required streaming hours, exclusivity, ownership of your VTuber persona, and termination conditions. If terms are unclear, demand clarification or legal review. Remember that ‚Äútalent exclusive‚Äù typically means you perform only for that agency ‚Äì make sure you understand what that means for side projects or collaborations.Check Policies and Support Systems: A legitimate company usually has written policies on harassment, content guidelines, and dispute resolution. When vetting an agency, ask about these policies. For example, is there a handbook or coordinator you can talk to about any problems? Are there transparent rules for how revenue is split? If the agency hesitates to answer these questions or has no formal policies, it is suspect. (By contrast, the Whitcomb Law guide suggests reviewing a company‚Äôs policies carefully to see how to report problems‚Äì use this approach for any talent agreement.) Legitimate VTuber agencies often advertise professional services (talent training, marketing support, tech help, merchandise production, etc.). They should present themselves with a proper business presence: a clear website, public contact info, and reasonable expectations. Avoid agencies that seem amateurish (e.g. only a social media page, no official domain, no way to contact easily) or that behave unprofessionally during your application process (e.g. they fail to respond to emails, or they pressure you to join immediately). Remember that being an agency talent is not your only option. Some VTubers succeed independently or through community networks. If you go solo, be prepared to handle everything yourself (streaming setup, brand design, self-promotion). Building an audience organically takes time, so you might start as independent and join an agency later once you have more leverage. Keep backup plans: save money for emergencies, and never rely on an agency as your only source of support. Whenever possible, treat your VTuber persona as your intellectual property. For instance, retain authorship of your character design or use independent servers for streaming. If you work as an independent contractor, consider forming a small company or having a legal agreement that grants you ownership of your content. This way, if a bad agency tries to claim your VTuber identity, you can contest it.Finally, trust your instincts. If an agency‚Äôs pitch sounds  good to be true, or if early interactions leave you uneasy (e.g. they pry into personal matters, insist on immediate commitment, or make unreasonable demands during audition), they‚Äôre likely unsafe. Female VTubers should be especially careful about agencies that overemphasize ‚Äúimage‚Äù or personal sacrifice. Agencies exist to  your career, not to exploit your work or well-being.The Rise of Indie Vtubers amidst Corporate TurmoilEmpowering Yourself and OthersBy educating yourself on what a black-company environment looks like, you can avoid the worst traps. Always read any contract fully and keep records of all interactions. Look for solid references and don‚Äôt hesitate to negotiate or say no to clauses you find unfair. Remember that as a performer, you have rights: you can consult a lawyer, report illegal labor practices to authorities, and in many places even form or join a union. Sharing information with other VTubers creates a community defense ‚Äì if you hear friends discussing a bad agency, take it seriously and spread the word to warn others (within safe legal limits).The VTuber industry is still young and evolving, and female performers should not have to endure abuse to succeed. By spotting warning signs early, documenting any mistreatment, and speaking up for proper contracts and safe workplaces, you protect yourself and pave the way for a healthier community. Trustworthy agencies recognize that supporting their talent‚Äôs safety and creativity is the only way to thrive. If every VTuber ‚Äì especially women, who often carry extra burdens ‚Äì stands together and demands fair treatment, exploitative ‚Äúblack‚Äù practices will become harder to ignore. Your skills and creativity deserve respect, compensation, and a positive work environment. If an agency won‚Äôt give that, better to walk away than sacrifice yourself for someone else‚Äôs profit.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hololive Night returns to Dodgers Stadium in July - MSN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxQVFJNS0F0QnkzOVRleDFRa1dWUVRoRktOQ2dUdUlldkFKWENkU1hVWHROS1JveHBTckxRcC1TT2EycTRJMm9QWVUwX0E0QkJ5bEVzQVRvMjdoaFlrOF9lUXZyZ2N4amI2YUVzOFVjaFJ2VUZpM2hyNnJpWS1XMW5lYkVCZTRKcjJEaElxd0I5cDFCOTFFQTNyLVdSQVVOLWc?oc=5</link><author></author><category>hololive</category><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 01:07:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.google.com/topics/CAAqKAgKIiJDQkFTRXdvTkwyY3ZNVEZuWDNKc2EyaDRjQklDWlc0b0FBUAE?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;ceid=US:en">hololive on Google News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hololive Night returns to Dodgers Stadium in July - mp3sandnpcs.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxNVnNGRnVxdjhiNnJXUklZMEFJRWR5OW9rMklyWjB0aEpNbHdwbUJ2SjMxb3A0ZElfdkRFN1lWcTVQZ3FJMjBIWGtKVzdtcURXN2Jhd0UxUGt3RjRoQlluTEk1RE9QX2h3Q205LV9jWk9iT2dlWFVkbzF0ZXhRSUxCWnJIVHY?oc=5</link><author></author><category>hololive</category><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 17:17:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.google.com/topics/CAAqKAgKIiJDQkFTRXdvTkwyY3ZNVEZuWDNKc2EyaDRjQklDWlc0b0FBUAE?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;ceid=US:en">hololive on Google News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hololive English 3rd Concert Will Be at Radio City Music Hall - Siliconera</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxQTElnZ3NibDlMcWZ2dC1hRFNnMVlpb05ta1lPYjBtdHBPbG81aVZRODVGa0ItcmozNnB1UlJXMEtqYUV6dnViWDhST3ZCeUNMR1RLUFluZU00anNjN0dYMWJIdWotOEd4UWhPSGp5M0YzZUNwbGRQWWZab1Y4T05aNGdWMzJoa0NMRkhtSFpIOWZFQTg?oc=5</link><author></author><category>hololive</category><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.google.com/topics/CAAqKAgKIiJDQkFTRXdvTkwyY3ZNVEZuWDNKc2EyaDRjQklDWlc0b0FBUAE?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;ceid=US:en">hololive on Google News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>VTuber Sakura Miko Joins PUBG MOBILE in New Limited-Time Collaboration - Anime Corner</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxOSUE1T052RkhTRkZITEJ5VkZ1ZEpXNlZ1NUt6dm9xRGdpRXRscTNCdVE4ZktObjRQSmVFZ1VFbXJVYlFDeWk2UVBqWGNpUWZtcVFXSmd0eHNMdTRTNlltQ1AySHFhNkhnYjdxRHpuUjZibVRrZDJIa0JtVG44RldobjFDYUVtZnNYc2R6Z01BUEF2OXlsdzdGYXlB?oc=5</link><author></author><category>hololive</category><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 08:45:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.google.com/topics/CAAqKAgKIiJDQkFTRXdvTkwyY3ZNVEZuWDNKc2EyaDRjQklDWlc0b0FBUAE?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;ceid=US:en">hololive on Google News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>COVER Corporation Announces hololive English 3rd Concert -All for One-!

Total revenue climbed 34.0% year-on-year to ¬•42,877 million, operating profit rose 31.7% to ¬•16,280 million, and net profit increased 31.9% to ¬•11,511 million .However, beneath the headline figures lies a notable weakness: NIJISANJI EN (the English-language VTuber branch) saw a marked revenue decline of approximately 45% year-on-year, and its quarterly revenue has trended downward throughout FY2025.4. This article unpacks the company‚Äôs overall performance, dissects each business segment, and explores the factors behind NIJISANJI EN‚Äôs ongoing contraction and its implications for future strategy.Link to the financial report.Overall Financial Highlights Driven by explosive growth in Commerce (+65.8% YoY Q4) and robust Event and Promotion performance . Operating margin remained near 38%, testament to tight cost controls even amid rapid expansion. Operating cash flow of ¬•11.2 billion, enabling ¬•7.5 billion share buybacks and an aggregate dividend payout of ¬•4 billion .Livestreaming (12% of FY2025.4 revenue): ¬•6,997 million in FY2025.4 versus ¬•5,892 million in FY2024.4, up 18.7%. YouTube membership fees, ‚ÄúSuper Chat‚Äù contributions, and ad revenue. High 38%+ operating margin, reflecting low direct costs. Steady growth expected as viewership and engagement rise with new VTuber debuts and large-scale streaming events .: ¬•26,292 million, up 64.8% YoY. Merchandise tied to NIJISANJI 7th Anniversary, unit-based collaborations, plush-toy pop-ups, and in-store initiatives (e.g., the first permanent ‚ÄúNui Store‚Äù in Yokohama) . Manufacturing efficiencies improved direct-cost ratio despite higher volume. Seasonal product launches (e.g., anniversary, seasonal merchandise) lead to Q-to-Q swings in revenue.Events (7% of FY2025.4 revenue): ¬•2,829 million, +61.9% YoY. NIJISANJI Fes 2025 at Makuhari Messe saw stronger-than-expected online post-ticket sales and sold-out side events . Growing scale and fan engagement, with sell-out tours planned for the 7th anniversary live tour in FY2026.4.: ¬•6,651 million, +25.1% YoY. Corporate tie-ups (e.g., MUFG Bank, Acecook), IP collaborations, and a rising average project size . Continued expansion into diverse industries, leveraging VTuber IP for marketing.Cost Structure & ProfitabilityCost of Sales (53.1% of revenue) (fees to VTubers, platform fees, merchandise/event manufacturing): ¬•19,909 million, ~46.4% of revenue . (allocations of SG&A): ¬•2,858 million, 6.7% of revenue.Increased due to ¬•400 million in bonuses for employees and ¬•40 million in depreciation corrections tied to studio relocations .Q4 FY2025.4 operating margin: 38.0%, in line with the full-year margin. Margin stability despite aggressive investment in new studios and VTuber debuts.NIJISANJI EN: A Case of Continuous DeclineWhile J-market VTuber operations soared, the English-language arm (NIJISANJI EN) faced persistent revenue erosion across FY2025.4:Full-Year Revenue CollapseNIJISANJI EN revenue plunged from ¬•4,866 million to ¬•2,658 million .Quarterly revenue has trended downward after Q2 FY2025.4, with Q4 at just ¬•597 million, despite stable or growing headcount .VTuber Count vs. Revenue/VTuber Grew from 127 in Q1 to 135 by Q4 . With rising headcount and falling total revenue, average revenue per VTuber has halved, pressuring profitability and ROI on English-market investments.Market Saturation & Competition: English VTuber space fragmented, with local creators and competing agencies diluting audience attention.Content Localization Gaps: Translated or Japan-centric IP may not fully resonate with global fans. Twitch, Kick, and emerging platforms fragment viewership beyond YouTube.Merchandising Challenges: Logistics, higher shipping costs, and limited physical store presence outside Japan hamper Commerce growth. Develop EN-native characters with storylines and cultural touchpoints tailored to Western audiences.Expand Local Partnerships: Collaborate with Western brands, streamers, and events to boost visibility beyond the Japanese fanbase. Leverage Twitch, Discord, and region-specific platforms to capture non-YouTube viewership. Reassess production and promotion spend to align with the scaled-down revenue base; consider regional hubs to reduce overhead.Growth Investments & Shareholder Returns Tripled distribution studio capacity, boosting average operating hours by 30‚Äì100% across 2D/3D/recording studios . 19 new debuts in FY2025.4; Virtual Talent Academy drew 41,000 audition applications . ¬•2.1 billion invested in studio build-out; additional spend on platform tooling and 3D/Live2D improvements. ¬•7.5 billion in buybacks, ¬•4 billion in dividends, with a target payout ratio ‚â•30% from FY2026.4 onward . More large-scale streaming spectacles to drive membership and ad revenue. Continued merchandise diversification, expanded pop-ups (e.g., ‚ÄúNui Store‚Äù), and global shipping enhancements. NIJISANJI World Tour 2025 ‚Äì Sendai and 7th Anniversary live tour. Broader IP tie-ups with global brands, aiming to offset NIJISANJI EN headwinds.ANYCOLOR‚Äôs FY2025.4 results underscore its dominance in the VTuber ecosystem in Japan, with record Commerce and Event revenues fueling robust profitability. However, the steep decline in NIJISANJI EN highlights the challenge of translating domestic success to international markets. Addressing content localization, platform diversification, and cost optimization will be critical to reversing EN‚Äôs downturn. If managed effectively, the company‚Äôs strong cash flow and balanced investment/return strategy position it well for further growth in FY2026.4 and beyond.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Latest Hololive Nendoroid Is a Casual Usada Pekora Figure - Siliconera</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxORHkxZXR4Qy02U2lqNHN4VEJoVWVqV01UUmVYMEt4SldCTFNBUmRycF9BMHBZZnN5Z20xVWlDLUlRWjk0UlBianp5YjlsaW5udkljeHBHUnlEUXhfRDlSQ3BCM2J0dUs3ZHBmWXFZYnNJQjN5QVQ1MlpLX29YVVdVa2Y5TDhobklVWFhCaUNB?oc=5</link><author></author><category>hololive</category><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 21:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.google.com/topics/CAAqKAgKIiJDQkFTRXdvTkwyY3ZNVEZuWDNKc2EyaDRjQklDWlc0b0FBUAE?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;ceid=US:en">hololive on Google News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I am in Google Maps Now üåé</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Ykm7FNTCcYY</link><author>hwikky</author><category>yt-holo</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Ykm7FNTCcYY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 19:38:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI-K3cqRc7whDl_DAC_trYw">hwikky</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[‚ú® Watch what other things I did in Japan: https://youtu.be/HDpaNavLFO8

Despite her looks, Ina‚Äônis is actually a priestess of the Ancient Ones. One day, she picked up a strange book and then started to gain the power of controlling tentacles. To her, tentacles are just a part in her ordinary life; it has never been a big deal for her. However, her girly mind does want to get them dressed up and stay pretty.
After gaining power, she started hearing Ancient Whispers and Revelations. Hence, she began her VTuber activities to deliver random sanity checks on humanity, as an ordinary girl.
A Nephilim who was once the embodiment of hope back in ‚ÄúThe Paradise‚Äù.
While she has left to set off on an adventure, she continues to deliver hope through her lyrics and songs, with determination in her voice.
She also bears the precarious and unstable dual nature of a half-demon and half-angel; this phenomenon can be observed on rare occasions, in the form of the most unpredictably
yaba‚Äî*ahem*, ‚Äúsurprising‚Äù, comments from IRyS herself. Bewildering those around her is but another unexpected charm of her duality.
Formed from the crystallization of all forms of human emotion, Koseki Bijou is ‚ÄúThe Jewel of Emotions.‚Äù
Over years and years, emotions of beauty and filth alike have woven into her under immense pressure, resulting in an unmatched brilliance.
Her ancient, mystic brilliance caused strife between the masses of the greedy, who fought over ownership of her. This led to her being imprisoned in secrecy, far from the reach of humans.
It seems as though when she encounters people, and particularly their good emotions, her radiance shines even brighter.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Getting Hyped for NEW HOLOLIVE X DODGERS that I can&apos;t go to</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrCFt5qmDf0</link><author>hwikky</author><category>yt-holo</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/zrCFt5qmDf0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 8 Jun 2025 22:53:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI-K3cqRc7whDl_DAC_trYw">hwikky</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[hololive Official Stream HERE üëâ https://www.youtube.com/live/UjhwpeT6788

Some fans are just casual viewers, but the  (‚Äúgachi-koi,‚Äù ‚Äúunicorns,‚Äù etc.) make or break a VTuber‚Äôs career. These super-devoted fans invest time, money, and emotion in you . Understanding who they are (and who casual viewers are) is the first step.A  is made of viewers who treat your avatar and persona almost like a beloved idol. They form  ‚Äì one-sided bonds where fans feel close to you even though you only interact through the screen.. Hardcore fans come in flavors:  (heavy ‚Äúin-love‚Äù supporters) and  fans. Gachikoi are the ultimate super-fans: they buy every merch, subscribe, member, and tip just to support you ‚Äì basically your virtual ‚Äúboyfriend/girlfriend,‚Äù showering you with money and praise Unicorn fans, by contrast, are totally into your . They demand  (Cute Girls Doing Cute Things) ‚Äì think solo or all-girl collabs ‚Äì and don‚Äôt care about your off-screen life. They‚Äôll quit your channel if you invite male collabs, but otherwise they just love every adorable thing you do. Both types are highly parasocial ‚Äì they feel like your best friends (or lovers), even though you only know them through the stream .In short, a hardcore audience is . They will subscribe, join paid memberships, buy merch, draw fan art, organize Discord communities, and defend you online. Casual viewers might stop by for a stream or two, but hardcore fans stick around and actively fuel your channel. As VTuber Sensei puts it, ‚ÄúCasual fans might stop by‚Ä¶ but hardcore fans are the ones who stick around and invest their time, money, and emotional energy‚Äù. Those hardcore fans keep you relevant in a crowded market, and VTubers who nurture them enjoy long-term success even when casual viewership dips.Idol Culture and VTuber FandomVTubers didn‚Äôt emerge in a vacuum ‚Äì they grew from , and that cultural heritage shapes fandom expectations. In J-pop idol culture, fans often expect their idols to stay ‚Äúpure,‚Äù forming one-sided romantic feelings and even demanding a ‚Äúno-dating‚Äù image. VTubing inherited this model in some ways. Like traditional idols, VTubers present carefully crafted personas: colorful avatars and consistent characters that never break character in public. This  approach lets fans project feelings onto you. Parasocial relationships are at the heart of this: viewers feel a unique closeness because they can chat with you live, send donations, and even see your avatar react in real time . This direct interaction takes idol culture‚Äôs ‚ÄúIdol Journey‚Äù ‚Äì where fans support an idol‚Äôs growth ‚Äì and turbocharges it with technology.Because of this idol influence, many VTuber fans come with very specific expectations. They want you to be cute, supportive, and accessible, but also mysterious. They crave : they‚Äôll remember your catchphrases, avatar details, inside jokes ‚Äì and expect the same personality each time. This can lead to pressure: some hardcore fans (especially unicorns) even  that their fave VTuber not interact with male streamers, mirroring old idol rules . On the positive side, idol culture also means fans will go all-out supporting you ‚Äì buying albums (read: music CDs), concert tickets (3D live events), and tons of merch. The Hololive 3D live concerts are a perfect example: fans passionately cheer and spend just like idol concert-goers.Idol culture‚Äôs key legacy is . Fans develop an ‚ÄúIdol Journey‚Äù bond: they follow you from debut onward, cheering as you improve (level up your streaming, celebrate milestones, drop music, etc.). The more you lean into that persona-driven, interactive style, the more you encourage that idol-like loyalty. As Vtuber Sensei notes, VTubers and idols share a powerful phenomenon: a ‚Äúspecial and strong parasocial relationship‚Äù where fans feel personally connected to the avatar. This closeness fuels both the emotional satisfaction of fans and their willingness to  on you (time, money, clout).Why Hardcore Fans Matter: Economics and EmotionHardcore fans are literally the  of a VTuber‚Äôs career ‚Äì financially and emotionally. Economically, the VTuber world thrives on fan spending. VTuber streams only bring in modest ad revenue unless you‚Äôre huge, so most income comes from fans: superchats/donations, memberships, sponsorships, merch, and live events Hardcore fans pay for all of it. They‚Äôll subscribe or join multiple tiers of memberships (often 5$‚Äì30$/month) because it‚Äôs like joining your ‚Äúfan club‚Äù ‚Äì and 70‚Äì80% of that is your profit. They‚Äôll also drop big Super Chats (with YouTube taking 30%), send tips, and buy merchandise even at high prices. In fact, VTubers make up seven of the top ten most Superchatted channels on YouTube, showing how aggressively fans tip their favorites. According to industry data, merchandising is exploding: Cover Corp (Hololive‚Äôs parent) saw nearly 80% growth in merch sales in one quarter, thanks to fans buying everything from official card games to limited-edition hoodies. (Those fans are hardcore!)Even beyond money, hardcore fans are an emotional pillar. They form communities ‚Äì Discord servers, Reddit groups, fan art boards ‚Äì that keep your brand alive between streams. They constantly share clips, hype up events, and defend you from trolls. Psychologically, VTubers offer fans . Many viewers are socially isolated young men; watching your stream gives them a sense of companionship and a ‚Äúsafe space‚Äù to interact. When you thank someone by name, laugh at their jokes, or remember their pet‚Äôs name, it fulfills a real human need. Hardcore fans often report feeling happier and less lonely after watching their favorite VTuber. This emotional bond makes them fiercely protective: they‚Äôll rally behind you during tough times and celebrate your victories as their own.Crucially, VTubers who nurture hardcore fans tend to thrive long-term. These fans keep watching and supporting even if algorithms change or casual viewer counts dip. ‚ÄúThe loyalty these hardcore fans provide is essential to the long-term success of any VTuber‚Äù. In lean times, these die-hards are the ones still clicking ‚Äúlive,‚Äù still dropping the odd Super Chat, still repping your merch. They basically pay your bills ‚Äì or at least bankroll the majority of your income. Vtuber Sensei bluntly advises: cherish those hardcore fans, because ‚Äúthey will carry you through your VTubing journey‚Äù.Casual vs Hardcore Viewers: How They Impact Your ChannelNot all viewers are equal. Understanding  vs.  is key to growing and sustaining your community: They catch a stream when they can, maybe watch an interesting game, or tune in during a big event or collaboration. They rarely stick around for the full stream and will drop off early if something better comes up. They might follow your highlights on YouTube or social media, but they don‚Äôt tune in regularly. At best, some casual fans will subscribe or join the lowest membership tier only to get a few extra perks, but they  or buy merch. These viewers boost your raw view count, but they‚Äôre unlikely to leave comments, tip a lot, or build community. You can‚Äôt rely on casuals for steady revenue ‚Äì in fact, Vtuber Sensei notes you ‚Äúrarely [make] a living off‚Äù a purely casual audience unless you have the backing of a big agency. A special subset of casuals ‚Äì they  appear for big events (like collabs or announcements) and vanish otherwise. They might contribute a like but never engage deeply or donate. These give spikes in viewership statistics, but don‚Äôt build your core fanbase.Hardcore (High-Value) Viewers: These are the Gachikoi and Unicorns we described. They watch every stream they can, often for hours on end. They engage in chat, donate superchats on occasion, and subscribe to memberships (sometimes multiple tiers). They also help set trends ‚Äì streaming cons told by clips and fan works. In forums and social media, they praise you and defend you if someone trolls you. These fans directly boost important metrics: high concurrent viewer counts, longer average watch times, and active chat logs help with platform algorithms. In short, hardcore fans are far more  per person than casuals.The impact on your channel shows up in two ways: Casuals give you random spikes, but hardcore viewers give you consistency. A stream with mostly hardcore fans might have a smaller peak, but steady viewership and high engagement (like chat activity or superchats throughout). This consistent support makes your channel look healthier to platforms. Over time, hardcore fans also help you trend ‚Äì they share clips and fan content, bringing in new eyes. Hardcore fans pay for memberships, merch, and donations, whereas casuals rarely do. For example, a VTuber membership (fan club) can cost the equivalent of $5‚Äì$30 a month, which adds up when dozens or hundreds of hardcore fans join. Merchandise sales (T-shirts, keychains, plushies with your avatar) only happen when fans are  in you. Casuals might buy a sticker, but hardcore fans will buy  you release. A strong core of super-fans thus keeps the bank account healthy even if occasional viewers trickle.In short: casual viewers grow numbers; hardcore fans grow longevity. A massive but shallow audience can flame out; a modest but dedicated fanbase can sustain a career Hololive English Case StudiesHololive English (HoloEN) provides real-world examples of how cultivating a hardcore audience pays off. The first generation (Gawr Gura, Mori Calliope, Takanashi Kiara, Ninomae Ina‚Äônis, Watson Amelia) each built fiercely loyal followings with distinct brands. Gura leaned into her shark-theme and cheeky personality, focusing on gaming and singing streams. Fans (her self-named ‚ÄúChumbuds‚Äù and ‚ÄúShrimps‚Äù) adopted her catchphrases, fan art, and even fan-made songs. She hit millions of subs in record time, illustrating how a clear niche plus consistent persona attracts both casual viewers  hardcore fans. The  around Gura (shark loli, memes) spread virally on Twitter/Reddit, showing hardcore fan involvement.Mori Calliope (Dead Beats): As Hololive‚Äôs musical emcee, Mori focused on original music. Her fans eagerly bought her albums and merch whenever released, treating each song drop like an idol single. Calliope‚Äôs emphasis on songwriting and character lore gave fans deep content to engage with. Her dedicated music supporters famously streamed her songs en masse (some hits reached millions of views in hours), exemplifying how tailored content and community hype fuel success.Cover Corp‚Äôs financial reports reflect this engagement. For example, Cover reported a ~50% revenue jump in one quarter, attributing much of it to new VTuber debuts (bringing new fanbases) and merch sales up nearly 80% thanks to fan demand. These numbers wouldn‚Äôt exist without super-fans snapping up products and promoting the brand.(Note: Hololive is a prime example of corporate strategy. But many independent female VTubers apply the same principles. Nimi Nightmare, for instance with a majority of male fans, leans heavily on GFE interaction to nurture those fans. Independent VTubers often rely even more on core fans since they lack corporate marketing, so they mirror these idol tactics in how they engage and brand themselves.)Actionable Strategies: Attracting and Nurturing Your Core FansBuilding a hardcore audience takes deliberate effort. Here are concrete steps VTubers can use to attract, retain, and grow a loyal fanbase, rooted in community-proven tactics:Craft a Clear Persona & Niche: Know who you are and stick to it. Successful VTubers have a consistent character and theme. Maybe you‚Äôre the gentle ASMR storyteller, the over-the-top gamer, or the soothing 2D musician. Pick what makes you unique.  Gawr Gura focused on her shark motif and love of games/music, and that clear branding helped her fans ‚Äúget‚Äù her instantly. Your hardcore fans will rally around whatever distinctive trait or niche you own.Be Authentic and Responsive (Parasocial Bonding): Hardcore fans thrive on feeling close to you. During streams, , react to comments, and remember repeated viewers . Even small gestures make a big difference: a quick shoutout to ‚ÄúSuzuki-san‚Äù or remembering a regular viewer‚Äôs birthday makes them feel . Fans often say this personal touch is what makes them tune in every time. In short, treat your chat as friends. Be warm, caring, or playful ‚Äì whatever fits your persona ‚Äì and keep it consistent. One useful tactic is membership- or subscriber-only streams: e.g. a Q&A for subs or a private Discord hangout. This keeps interactions  for your core fans, deepening the bond without requiring 1-on-1 chats with every fan (setting a healthy boundary). Ironically, maintaining  mystery can make fans appreciate you more. You want to be engaging , but you don‚Äôt have to be on-call 24/7. Politely manage messages/DMs: for instance, direct fans to fan servers or use bots to handle routine stuff. This way, you stay safe from harassment but also make your live appearances feel more special. VTuber Sensei reminds creators to ‚Äúset boundaries‚Äîboth in what you share and how you respond to over-familiar fans‚Äù. Clear rules (e.g. no private social media DMs, no sharing personal info) protect you and remind fans that interactions happen mostly  on stream. This actually preserves the idol aura many fans expect. Keep your visuals and voice . Use the same avatar style and catchphrases on YouTube, Twitter, TikTok, etc. Hardcore fans notice if your persona wavers. If you‚Äôre a gentle story-teller, keep that vibe even on Instagram. If you‚Äôre the goofy gamer, meme-hard on Twitter too. Consistency helps fans feel at home and spreads your identity: for example, Gura‚Äôs shark theme and Mori‚Äôs oni horns are instantly recognizable and used in memes and fan art. Also use platform features: update your Twitch panels with your logo colors, have a unique clap-emote on YouTube, etc. All this solidifies your brand and keeps fans engaged.Engage in Fan Communities: Join (or start) Discords, subreddits, Twitter hashtags, etc. Fan communities often flourish on their own, but your presence (even silently reading or occasionally dropping a message) shows you care. Fanart channels, meme channels, translation channels ‚Äì encourage them. When fans create fan art or fan songs, shout them out or react on stream. For example, when Mori‚Äôs fanmade music videos popped up, she publicly thanked the creators, which only fueled more creativity. This user-generated content keeps your fandom active. Also, consider contests or streaming games with fan-donated ideas. This co-creation makes fans feel invested in  success. Offer memberships and merch that hardcore fans love. Create  with genuine perks: special emotes, access to a private Discord voice chat on stream nights, or an exclusive monthly hangout stream . Make the perks feel like ‚Äújoining your inner circle.‚Äù For merch, start with simple things fans can wear or display: T-shirts, hoodies, phone cases, stickers with your avatar or catchphrase. Then consider big-ticket items: plushies, figures, or artwork prints. Limited drops and themed bundles (e.g. ‚ÄúFirst Anniversary Set‚Äù or ‚ÄúGame Tournament Hoodies‚Äù) create excitement. Hardcore fans buy merchandise to  and feel closer to you 6768. (Sales of merch are a  stream because once it‚Äôs made, fans buy repeatedly.)Exclusive & Behind-the-Scenes Content: Hardcore fans crave anything . This can be easy to implement. Do occasional  where you maybe try a new project or just hang out in low-key chats. Release behind-the-scenes clips on Patreon or YouTube membership only ‚Äì things like your VTuber rig setup, avatar design process, or blooper reels. The feeling of an ‚Äúinner circle‚Äù is priceless to fans. It says, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre more than a number; you‚Äôre a supporter who gets special access.‚Äù VTuber Sensei recommends, ‚Äúoffer your hardcore fans something special, like exclusive streams‚Ä¶ or behind-the-scenes content. Make them feel like part of an inner circle‚Äù. In the VTuber world, collabs can boost exposure. But to keep hardcore fans happy, pick your collabs . Many unicorn fans don‚Äôt like collabs with male streamers ‚Äì so if that‚Äôs your audience, you might want to prioritize all-female collabs or VTuber-only collabs. (Alternatively, handle it on stream: if you do a mixed-gender collab, reassure fans it‚Äôs just professional content and you‚Äôre not changing your persona. But expect a hit in revenue.) Likewise, collaborating with fans (fan artists, voice actors) can be a fun way to reward community members. But don‚Äôt spread collabs too thin ‚Äì fans sometimes feel betrayed if you suddenly stream with a random creator unrelated to your theme. Balance broadening your network with keeping your core brand. Hardcore fans often keep calendars to watch  streams. Maintaining a consistent streaming schedule helps them plan around your content. If fans know you‚Äôre live every Tuesday/Friday at 7pm, they‚Äôll regularly show up. Sudden cancellations or long hiatuses can lose momentum. Of course, life happens ‚Äì but give as much notice as possible and perhaps do a shorter backup stream or a quick chat so they aren‚Äôt left hanging. Ultimately, none of the above matters if the content doesn‚Äôt . Play games or do activities you genuinely enjoy (this keeps energy up), but also pay attention to what hardcore fans love: maybe chatty ‚ÄúJust Chatting‚Äù nights for bonding, or themed streams (karaoke nights, ASMR, storytelling, etc.) that fit your character. Analyze which streams get the most engagement or donations and do more of those. Variety is good, but a core identity (idol, artist, gamer, etc.) is key. High production values (good audio, visuals) also signal you care ‚Äì and in our avatars, even minor improvements (like a cool new wave effect when someone subs) can thrill fans.Handle Shoppers (Gachikoi) and Shippers Carefully: Some hardcore fans (gachikoi) might act overly possessive, shipping you with someone or demanding personal attention. Engage gently: thank them for support, but keep public comments professional. If a fan tries to force personal drama (‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt you dating so-and-so?‚Äù), it‚Äôs okay to politely ignore or set boundary. High-conflict drama can upset other fans, so manage it swiftly. However, don‚Äôt alienate them completely ‚Äì they still spend a lot on you. Redirect their passion: for example, start a fan art contest instead of a ‚Äúship‚Äù rumor.Embrace the Parasocial (But Carefully): Remember, hardcore fans  feeling they have a personal connection. Use parasocial techniques: use warm language like a friend, share ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù stories through your character (e.g. funny pet anecdotes, favorite foods), even role-play ‚Äúfield trips.‚Äù Just keep real personal details vague to maintain healthy boundaries. For example, talk about your day as if you‚Äôre with them ‚Äúlate night studying‚Äù or ‚Äúcooking dinner.‚Äù This closeness makes fans feel they truly know you, boosting loyalty. But at the same time, don‚Äôt pretend too realistically ‚Äì maintain character cues so fans remember it‚Äôs an avatar. It‚Äôs a balancing act between fantasy and authenticity.Marketing Savvy (VTuber Marketing): Even as a VTuber, some marketing thinking helps. Use SEO keywords in your video titles (‚ÄúVTuber audience,‚Äù ‚Äúparasocial relationship,‚Äù etc.) if that‚Äôs part of your strategy. But more importantly, engage fans on social media like a brand: post clips on TikTok or Twitter, run polls (‚ÄúWhat song should I cover next?‚Äù), and use fan-friendly hashtags. Announce merch or events with tease images. Some VTubers create countdowns or small puzzles leading up to big streams ‚Äì these gamify your content. All these strategies are part of VTuber marketing: building hype and staying top-of-mind for your core fans. As one VTuber guide notes, ‚ÄúIf your target audience is fans who want more than just casual chats, you‚Äôll use your persona and consistent messaging to attract them‚Äù. Show appreciation. Thank your member sub-hype trains on stream, post a ‚Äúthank you‚Äù tweet after hitting a goal, or send a fan a surprise gift (like a hand-signed art print) as a raffle prize. When fans feel recognized, they dig in even deeper. Many VTubers hold loyalty badges (e.g. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been a member for 6 months!‚Äù) or special titles for long-time followers. These small rewards keep hardcore fans around.The Takeaway: Make Hardcore Fans Your FoundationIn the fast-moving VTuber world, chasing every trend or viewer gimmick leads nowhere. The  are your foundation. They pay the bills, build the hype, and emotionally support you. Idol culture taught us that a passionate dedicated fanbase can turn a new face into a superstar. VTubers just have to tap into that by providing consistent, authentic content and fostering real connections.As VTuber Sensei puts it: ‚ÄúHardcore fans are the backbone of any successful VTuber brand. They buy your merch, show up to streams no matter what, and spread the word about you‚Äù. In other words, treat them like VIPs. Offer them exclusives, involve them in your journey, and always stay true to the persona they love. If you do that, you‚Äôll find those casual lurkers may slowly transform into your next super-fans.Remember: a parasocial relationship might only be ‚Äúone-sided,‚Äù but its rewards can be very real. Your hardcore audience isn‚Äôt just a number on a dashboard ‚Äì they‚Äôre a community that gives  to your VTuber career. So engage honestly, brand smartly, and always appreciate the Chumbuds, Shrimps, and Nincompees by name. They‚Äôll repay you with loyalty, revenue, and the joy of watching your character thrive.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Thursday, June 5 at 5:29 AM EDT</title><link>https://warosu.org/vt/thread/100898511</link><author></author><category>/vt/ /news/</category><category>VTubers</category><pubDate>Thu, 5 Jun 2025 09:29:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://vt.rita.moe/">/vt//news/</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>COVER Corporation Collaborates with We‚Äôs Star Ltd. for Mori Calliope themed New Liqueur ‚ÄúMoriZakura „ÇÇ„ÇäÊ°ú„ÉªËä±È≥•È¢®Êúà‚Äù</title><link>https://hololivepro.com/news_en/20250605-01-167/</link><author>Horii</author><category>hololive</category><pubDate>Thu, 5 Jun 2025 04:25:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hololivepro.com/">hololive Official News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[COVER Corporation (Minato-ku, Tokyo; CEO: Tanigo Motoaki) has announced an upcoming collaboration between VTuber agency hololive production and We‚Äôs Star Ltd.

I became a fan of hololive because of a smartphone game collab they did.‚ÄùThey explained that they have experienced going to a movie theater in Hokkaido in the past for a live viewing, but this time they planned to go to the live concert the following day, which was going to be their first time watching a hololive performance live, so they were really looking forward to it. The son has a lot of merchandise in his room, and told us that hololive for him is one of the ‚Äújoys in life.‚ÄùWe also spoke to an uncle-niece duo from Saitama who were enjoying some of the EXPO-exclusive food who told us that they ‚Äúbecame fans of hololive from watching YouTube Shorts.‚Äù The man continued, ‚ÄúI realised that my niece was also a fan when she bought hololive wafers,‚Äù and that EXPO 2025 was the first event they had attended.¬†He went on to say that, ‚Äúhololive is so comforting for me,‚Äù and his niece also expressed her love for hololive music and the trading card game (TCG): ‚ÄúMy favorite song is Captain Houshou Marine‚Äôs ‚ÄúBishoujyo Muzai‚ô°Pirates. I have also played in a hOCG tournament before.‚Äù She continued telling us her dreams: ‚ÄúI want to be a VTuber in the future. I‚Äôm designing characters with my school friend,‚Äù and when asked about why hololive is so appealing, she responded from the genuine perspective of a schoolchild, ‚ÄúEveryone is so fun and are like friends to me.‚ÄùWe Learned How to Sew! Hobbies and Community Through hololiveWhen asked about their thoughts on EXPO, three friends in their 20s from Chiba and Tokyo who had come in hololive Indonesia 1st Generation cosplay said, ‚ÄúWe had been looking forward to our oshis‚Äô food! Moona-chan‚Äôs (Moona Hoshinova) Nasi Goreng came with a postcard and it tasted really good!‚ÄùThe girls, who arrived at the event at 6:30 AM on the first train of the day, had started making their costumes a month prior. ‚ÄúWe bought all the material separately to suit our costumes.‚Äù they told us. ‚ÄúWhen COVID-19 hit, we couldn‚Äôt go outside so we started watching streams, which was something we were still able to enjoy without leaving the house,‚Äù they replied when asked about how they got into hololive. They were also addicted to hololive Indonesia content as a part of that.¬†They also talked about overcoming language barriers and communicating across borders: ‚ÄúWe couldn‚Äôt understand Indonesian at all in the beginning, but gradually started picking it up. Even now, we are looking up things in Indonesian, and interacting with Indonesian fans as well.‚Äù‚Äúhololive is one of our joys in life; we live for it. We usually wake up watching hololive and fall asleep to it too. It‚Äôs always there by our side regardless of whether we‚Äôre sad or happy.‚ÄùThey even gained new hobbies: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve even learned how to sew thanks to cosplaying.‚ÄùTwo self-professed otaku friends in their 20s came from Osaka and Tokyo to attend both days of EXPO. They told us that they planned to cosplay on the second day as Houshou Marine in costumes that they made by hand together. ‚ÄúWe were originally VTuber fans, and then got into hololive through watching 3rd Generation video shorts. We‚Äôll definitely be going to our oshi‚Äôs live concerts now!‚Äù said the hololive fans of four years.‚ÄúThe Magical Girl holoWitches! booth was really good. We were really moved by the costumes there,‚Äù they responded about EXPO 2025.Their passion for hololive was evident as they spoke: ‚ÄúWe watch our oshis every day: streams on our commutes and when we‚Äôre getting ready. We put on archived content, and it always feels like they‚Äôre with us. hololive is our lifeline‚Äîwe couldn‚Äôt survive without it.‚ÄùAnother fan of 3-4 years in their 40s hailing from Tokyo was with plushies of his oshi Tsunomaki Watame he had brought, enjoying an EXPO-exclusive drink. He told us that he had arrived at 7 in the morning and ‚Äúwas glad to see the mascot parade, something that [he doesn‚Äôt] normally get to see.‚ÄùHe spoke about the appeal of hololive: ‚ÄúIt is what comforts me on a daily basis.‚Äù‚ÄúWhen I recommend hololive to people, I tell them that there are so many different kinds of VTubers, so they can definitely find one that suits them.‚ÄùHe was at EXPO with two of his friends who gained another common interest thanks to hololive: ‚ÄúThey are longtime friends of mine who became fans of hololive because of my recommendations.‚Äùhololive Transcending Borders: From Online Encounters to Real-Life FriendshipsA fan of 5 years in his 30s who had traveled to Japan all the way from the Netherlands spoke about his love of cosplaying: ‚ÄúI really wanted to cosplay today, but I couldn‚Äôt get a ticket.‚Äù‚ÄúI have been cosplaying for over half of my life,‚Äù he asserted, stating that he had started cosplaying when he was 17. ‚ÄúI was really looking forward to the hololive English booth (ENigmatic Recollection). I‚Äôm so glad I was able to see the booth where all the members are together for the first time.‚ÄùA HOLOSTARS fan in her 20s who had traveled from Kanagawa talked to us about her oshis Rikka, Hanasaki Miyabi and Minase Rio and how she came across hololive production: ‚ÄúI started getting into them through watching their live content on TikTok about 2-3 years ago.‚Äù‚ÄúI was originally a fan of other streamers, but HOLOSTARS was the reason I became interested in VTubers,‚Äù she said, also mentioning that she has a channel membership on YouTube.Four Oozora Subaru fans who met on social media (one of whom was in Japan from South Korea) told us that ‚Äú[they] occasionally meet offline!‚ÄùThe one from South Korea also went on to say, ‚ÄúI first came across hololive at the start of 2022. Even in South Korea, there are events and collab cafes, and there‚Äôs even a live viewing for today‚Äôs event (EXPO).‚ÄùThey also told us from each of their perspectives what hololive means to the four of them: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a place that gives us energy.‚Äù‚ÄúI get energized from Subaru-chan‚Äôs (Oozora Subaru) streams.‚Äù‚ÄúIt‚Äôs entertainment that makes you feel positive.‚Äù‚ÄúI feel really close with them because we see not only how they are on regular streams, but who they are in daily life too.‚Äù‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so much content in the archive that you can never get sick of it.‚ÄùEXPO: The Culmination of Diverse Connections Made Through hololiveWe heard from people from all walks of life through these interviews over the two days at hololive SUPER EXPO 2025 Supported By BANDAI/hololive 6th fes.

Honestly, those days were such a whirlwind that I barely even remember them‚Ä¶(lol)I started working with Kawatsu in March 2024 and I clearly remember being asked, ‚ÄúHow many people are working with you?‚Äù and answering, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just me.‚Äù¬† Every time I explained the situation, so many people told me, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs insane!‚Äù (lol). Nevertheless, it was thanks to the support of my colleagues in other departments and collaborators such as Kawatsu that we were able to reach the point where the game was ready for release. I also felt I could draw on my own personal childhood memories of playing card games, which helped me a lot through this process.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>First Store in West Japan! hololive production official shop in Osaka Umeda Opening Soon!</title><link>https://hololive.hololivepro.com/en/events/shopumeda/</link><author>narita</author><category>hololive</category><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 02:45:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hololive.hololivepro.com/en">hololive Events</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Scheduled to Open on June 27th, 2025!hololive production official shop in Osaka Umeda will be the first store to open in western Japan, and the second store nationwide, and will feature new items using exclusive visuals drawn by illustrators ‰∏â‰πùÂëÇ and „ÇÄ„Åé„Åü.The first part of this series will feature five talents, with future releases scheduled.

The VTuber market as a whole was already worth billions: one estimate put the global VTuber industry at , projected to (zionmarketresearch.com). (Another analysis cites $3.3B in 2023 and predicts ~$45.8B by 2032 ().)The past few years saw record growth. StreamsCharts data for 2024 Q1‚ÄìQ3 (below) shows VTuber watch-hours climbing from ~430 million in Q1 to ~440M in Q2 ‚Äì roughly a (streamscharts.com). In Q3, however, hours dipped slightly to ~433M (a 1.5% quarterly drop (streamscharts.com), the first decline after six straight growth-quarters.The chart above illustrates the trend: after years of explosive growth, VTuber viewership is now stabilizing. Even so, totals remain far higher than pre-pandemic; and VTubers continue to occupy a growing share of overall streaming. According to Stream Hatchet, VTubers now command 3.7% of live-stream viewership (up 10√ó from five years earlier) (). This mainstreaming means big brand partnerships and mainstream media exposure for VTubers ‚Äì but it also invites scrutiny of the corporate models behind them.Corporate vs. Independent VTubing: Pros and ConsIn the VTuber world today there are : corporate (or ‚Äúagency‚Äù) talents vs. independent (or ‚Äúindie‚Äù) creators. Each has distinct advantages and drawbacks:Agency (Corporate) VTuber: Signing with a talent agency like Hololive, NIJISANJI, or VShojo often grants an enormous head start. Agencies provide high-end resources ‚Äúto elevate your content‚Äù: pro avatar design, technical support, and marketing  (vtubersensei.com). Talents get custom 2D/3D models crafted by experienced artists, polished overlays, editors, and even direction for content (vtubersensei.com). Importantly, agencies also bring instant exposure: a slot in a top agency means your debut is introduced to an existing fanbase, and you‚Äôll frequently collab with star classmates. Agencies handle promotion, sponsorships, and cross-channel events that an independent could never engineer alone (vtubersensei.com). In short, joining a well-known agency can give a huge jump in audience and production quality with far less effort on the part of the VTuber (vtubersensei.com).: All that support comes at a price. VTubers in agencies typically sign long-term, exclusive contracts with many restrictions. They often lose creative control: certain games or topics might be off-limits, and even collaborations or sponsorships may need agency approval (vtubersensei.com). Agencies may enforce strict quotas (e.g. required streaming hours), and because the persona/avatar is usually , leaving the company often means abandoning that identity (vtubersensei.com). In practice, this means if a talent parts ways, they typically cannot take their character or channel with them ‚Äì the IP stays with the company. Additionally, agencies take a share of revenue (sometimes 30‚Äì50% or more) (vtubersensei.com), meaning VTubers earn  than they would independently. Some also report that agencies‚Äô bureaucratic structures and red tape can slow things down ‚Äì for example, one journalist noted complaints of  and ‚Äúlimited creative freedom‚Äù among Hololive staff (virtualsweet.jp).: Going solo gives a VTuber full autonomy. An indie can stream any content they want, manage their own schedule, and keep essentially  (minus platform fees) (vtubersensei.com). There are no corporate bosses or contracts limiting what you say or do, and you own all the IP for your character. Indies can pivot quickly or try unconventional ideas without waiting for approval. In many cases, this means greater creative satisfaction and control. For example, ex-agency talents have turned loose outside the corporate structure and invented new personas or content approaches that wouldn‚Äôt have been allowed on a corporate stream (hololivetoday.com)(jaxon.gg). In theory, indies have ‚Äúa higher degree of freedom‚Äù (as one analysis notes) and can connect more personally with fans as individual creators (news.viverse.com).: Of course, independents must handle . They must finance their own avatar and studio costs, learn editing and marketing, and build audiences from scratch (or rely on an existing fanbase). Without an agency team, technical glitches or business negotiations can fall entirely on the VTuber‚Äôs shoulders. Indies also often lack consistent production: many solo creators upload less frequently and may experience burnout when handling all roles. A common metaphor is that agency VTubers are like ‚Äúoffice workers‚Äù with support staff, whereas indies are solo entrepreneurs or artists (news.viverse.com). Crucially, breaking through as a completely new indie creator is very difficult. The vast majority of indie VTubers remain small or part-time; only a very few achieve large-scale success. This ‚Äúwinner-take-all‚Äù effect means that while headline success stories (often ex-agency talents) grab the limelight,  indies build modest channels that never rival agency peers. As one analysis points out, the roughly one-third market share held by indies is ‚Äúlikely accounted [for] by a select group of successful indies,‚Äù implying that the average independent creator has a tiny slice (hololivetoday.com).In summary, agencies offer a  with expensive production and built-in fans (vtubersensei.com), but at the cost of autonomy and revenue share(vtubersensei.com). Independent VTubers sacrifice that safety net for creative freedom and profit potential, but they face a steep climb to grow an audience on their own. The choice depends on a talent‚Äôs priorities: many aspiring VTubers join agencies for support, while others prize the indie path to keep their character and vision fully theirs (vtubersensei.com).Major Graduations and ExitsIn recent years, several high-profile VTubers have ‚Äúgraduated‚Äù or left their agencies, dramatically illustrating the tension between corporate control and personal freedom. These exits have drawn enormous fan attention and reshaped the scene. Below are some key examples:: In late 2024, Hololive English‚Äôs star  announced she would graduate (leave Hololive) effective January 3, 2025. Fauna, one of the most-watched English talents, surprisingly cited ‚Äúdifferences in opinions with management‚Äù as her reason (vchavcha.com). Hololive‚Äôs official statement even explicitly used the term ‚ÄúGraduation‚Äù (implying a permanent departure in contrast to ‚ÄúAffiliation‚Äù). Many saw this as hinting at creative disagreements or stress. Within hours of her final Hololive stream, eagle-eyed fans noticed Fauna‚Äôs original persona ‚ÄúLemonLeaf‚Äù returning to activity: her YouTube channel rebranded as  the day after her graduation (jaxon.gg) (virtualyoutuber.fandom.com). Nimi Nightmare debuted Jan 17, 2025 ‚Äì and blew past 300K subs almost immediately. In fact, her growth was meteoric: by Jan 18 she had 400K subs and by Jan 23 reached (virtualyoutuber.fandom.com). By late April 2025 she hit  subscribers, with debut streams peaking over 90,000 viewers (virtualyoutuber.fandom.com). This spectacular surge shows Fauna‚Äôs fans loyally following her to indie status. (Notably, Fauna also announced she‚Äôd make all her past membership content free after graduation (vchavcha.com) ‚Äì a sign she wanted a fresh start.)Selen Tatsuki (NIJISANJI EN): Selen‚Äôs exit from ANYCOLOR‚Äôs English branch in January 2024 caused an uproar. The sudden  of Selen‚Äôs contract (not a normal graduation) was officially attributed to ‚Äúbehavior unbecoming‚Äù (later rumors blamed social media incidents), but it happened just as she took a medical break, which sparked outrage. Fans and VTubers reacted with , accusing Nijisanji of mistreating talent (polygon.com). ANYCOLOR‚Äôs CEO later apologized for communication failures, but the damage to trust was palpable. Importantly, Selen immediately revived as indie persona: . In Feb 2024 she relaunched as Dokibird, and the fan response was staggering. On Feb 5, 2024, her YouTube subs jumped from ~9K to over , and one day later she hit  (virtualyoutuber.fandom.com). Her debut stream on Feb 7 peaked at ~127,000 concurrent viewers. By Feb 13 she reached  subs ‚Äì adding nearly  followers in 8 days (virtualyoutuber.fandom.com). By mid-March she was over 600K subs and hosting huge charity streams. In short, Selen/Dokibird‚Äôs meteoric indie success ‚Äì and the vitriol aimed at ANYCOLOR over her firing ‚Äì became a turning point. Many in the community lamented that a beloved VTuber was driven out by rigid corporate rules, yet immediately flourished independently (polygon.com (virtualyoutuber.fandom.com).Pomu Rainpuff (NIJISANJI EN): Pomu was an original member of Nijisanji EN‚Äôs first generation . By August 2023 she had amassed over  on YouTube (jaxon.gg) and seemed destined for big stardom. Then, in January 2024, Pomu announced a sudden graduation from Nijisanji EN citing burnout and . The news shocked fans; Pomu herself lamented that she had to turn down exciting projects due to agency constraints (though she said little publicly). Nearly three months later, in April 2024, Pomu re-emerged ‚Äì but this time as her original indie avatar ‚ÄúMint Fant√¥me (Maid Mint)‚Äù. As an indie, she immediately drew her old fans: within weeks she reached around (jaxon.gg), and by April 2025 she had about  subscribers (her numbers are still growing) (businessinsider.com). While Maid Mint‚Äôs count is smaller than Pomu‚Äôs peak, it shows a devoted following. Pomu/Maid Mint‚Äôs story is unusual in that she went from indie ‚Üí corporate ‚Üí indie, and yet maintained a sizable audience. Many fans cheered her return as Maid Mint, seeing it as a ‚Äúsecond chance‚Äù at streaming on her own terms.: Gawr Gura, one of Hololive‚Äôs celebrated  talents and the single-most-subscribed VTuber in the world ((over 4.5 million subs (essential-japan.com)), stunned the community in April 2025 by announcing her graduation effective May 1. The reason given was familiar: ‚Äúdifferences with management and the direction of the company‚Äù(essential-japan.com). The news was met with heartbreak and speculation. In a twist echoing Fauna, just days after her last Hololive stream, fans discovered Gura‚Äôs new independent channel. Now rebranded as , her debut video quickly confirmed the speculation ‚Äì and her audience reacted at warp speed. Within 24 hours, Sameko Saba‚Äôs YouTube and Twitter followed count exploded to jaxon.gg) (remember, that‚Äôs from near-zero overnight!). This makes Gura the latest example of a top VTuber successfully migrating to indie status without losing fan support. Cover Corp has emphasized that it still owns the ‚ÄúGawr Gura‚Äù character, so the new persona has a different name and look, but the loyal fanbase nearly instantly crossed over (jaxon.gg).Each of these graduations ‚Äì Fauna, Selen, Pomu, Gura ‚Äì sent shockwaves through the VTuber fandom. Fan reaction was overwhelmingly supportive of the talent. Social media exploded with messages like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm loyal to my oshi (favorite), not the company (hololivetoday.com). Viewers overwhelmingly took the side of the VTuber, trusting her narrative over the agency‚Äôs. Crowdfunding efforts like charity streams by Dokibird (raising $250K+) showed fans rallying to help the talent succeed. The common sentiment was that the content and personality of the individual, not the corporate label, were the real draw.In many cases, ex-corporate VTubers have indeed thrived independently, backed by these fans. Both Dokibird and Nimi Nightmare hit half a million subscribers within days/weeks of debuting. Maid Mint found over 300K as an indie. Gura‚Äôs Sameko is at ~200K after just a day. These stars have already shown they can monetize directly: for example, Dokibird‚Äôs February 9 ‚ÄúMerch Launch‚Äù stream generated nearly  in YouTube superchats and tips (virtualyoutuber.fandom.com) ‚Äì more than she ever got as an agency talent in the same time span. Fauna‚Äôs merchandise sold out instantly. In short, the indie paths of these former corpo talents have been validated by the market: their audiences followed them and even expanded.At the same time, it remains an open question whether completely new VTubers (with no corporate pedigree) can break out at a similar level. So far, the most successful independents are often veterans or have compelling niches. Even Filian, one of the biggest ‚ÄúKojinzei‚Äù VTubers mentioned by Forbes, ironically joined a small agency in 2023, blurring the lines (news.viverse.com). Generally, analysts note that the indie viewership pie is dominated by the same ‚Äúsuperstar‚Äù phenomenon: a few big names get the lion‚Äôs share of views (hololivetoday.com). Fresh faces will need something truly unique to garner mass appeal without an agency‚Äôs marketing engine. It‚Äôs still early, but the expectation in the community is that fan loyalty will follow personalities ‚Äì so a crafty and charismatic new indie might still grow large, just as Dokibird did. But they will be entering a more competitive and saturated market.Industry Statistics: Viewership, Graduation Rates, and RevenueTo understand these trends, it helps to look at the data. Third-party trackers and market analysts have documented how VTuber viewership and business metrics are evolving: StreamsCharts reports that over the past few quarters, VTuber audience growth has plateaued. After reaching record watch-hours in late 2023 and early 2024, the numbers leveled off. VTubers still command hundreds of millions of hours watched per quarter; Q3 2024 had about  watched (streamscharts.com) (vs. 440M in Q2). By one analysis, live-stream viewership attributable to VTubers has grown 10√ó over 5 years (), indicating explosive long-term growth, but short-term quarterly figures are now flat or even slightly down. Unique active VTuber channels fell below 5,000 in Q3 2024 (streamscharts.com), reflecting some consolidation.Agency vs Indie Market Share: Analysts estimate indies consistently hold around 35‚Äì36% of total VTuber watch-time. StreamsCharts pie-charts for Q3 2024 show independents at about , compared to Hololive‚Äôs ~23.5% and Nijisanji‚Äôs 18.9% (streamscharts.com). (Other agencies like VShojo, accelerators, etc., fill out the rest.) Hololive Today‚Äôs analysis similarly notes that independents have been stable at ~36% of viewership across recent quarters (hololivetoday.com). In other words, while the top agencies are still large, indies now represent over one-third of the VTuber audience by watch-time. This split is unusual: most entertainment niches are far more concentrated. It underscores that the VTuber audience is fragmented and that no single agency fully dominates.Graduation and Turnover Rates: Exact industry-wide figures are hard to come by, but 2024 saw unusually high turnover. ANYCOLOR closed its Indonesian and Indian NIJISANJI branches in 2023 and terminated several international talents. Cover also had multiple graduations and some suspensions. These high-profile exits (Fauna, Ame, Mumei, Gura, plus others like Hololive JP member Chloe, Aqua and Shion) have alarmed fans. For a sense of scale: NIJISANJI EN‚Äôs watch-hours fell by  in December 2024 (reddit.com) (partly due to losing talents and halting debuts), while NIJISANJI JP‚Äôs hours grew. StreamsCharts even noted that in late 2024, Nijisanji EN was by far the worst-performing branch of ANYCOLOR, leading to speculation about merging it back into the main company. Despite short-term turbulence, the VTuber industry remains highly lucrative. In 2020, the top 300 YouTube channels that year made ~$26M from VTubers (konvoy.vc). Aggregate market research suggests  in global VTuber revenue. As noted, Zion Market Research estimated ~$6.3B market value in 2023 (zionmarketresearch.com). (Other sources cite smaller or larger numbers, but all agree on a large, fast-growing market.) Much of this revenue comes from fan support: in the VTuber model, donations/superchats and merchandise sales form the bulk of income. For example, Kiryu Coco once earned ~$800K via superchats in a year (konvoy.vc). The new breakout indies are already pulling huge donation totals: Dokibird raised $252K for charity in early 2024 (virtualyoutuber.fandom.com), and Nimi Nightmare set a VTuber record by raising $361K in one charity stream (virtualyoutuber.fandom.com). These figures illustrate that fans are willing to directly finance independent VTubers just as they did with agency stars. The fortunes of VTuber agencies themselves have reflected these controversies. Both ANYCOLOR and Cover Corp (Hololive‚Äôs parent) are public companies in Japan, so their stock prices respond to news. For instance, ANYCOLOR‚Äôs shares  in the weeks following Selen Tatsuki‚Äôs termination and other setbacks (investing.com). An analyst report noted that fans ‚Äúaccused [ANYCOLOR] of mistreating its rising talent‚Äù and pointed out the company‚Äôs repeated abrupt restructuring (closing whole country branches) (investing.com). Cover Corp has weathered more stable growth, but even it has faced scrutiny. In early 2024, Cover publicized that it had taken legal action in  against fans/critics (cover-corp.com), which some observers worried could hurt its image.Cover‚Äôs latest financial reportControversies Undermining Agency TrustThe shift toward indies is closely tied to a series of scandals and trust issues at the big agencies. Fans have grown increasingly aware of behind-the-scenes problems:Abrupt Terminations and Non-Transparent Graduations: Agencies sometimes cite vague reasons for cutting ties. Fans were outraged by how arbitrarily Hololive or NIJISANJI jettisoned talent in 2024 and 2025. For example, both Fauna and Gura ‚Äúgraduated‚Äù with explanations like ‚Äúmanagement differences‚Äù (vchavcha.com) (essential-japan.com), leaving fans to speculate what really happened. Anycolor‚Äôs sudden firing of Selen mid-leave was particularly poorly handled; Nijisanji‚Äôs official statement admitted they‚Äôd harassed her and her emergency contact while she was hospitalized after a suicidal attempt, further enraging the community. Many in VTubing now demand transparency: the lack of clear policy around terminations has seeded distrust. Leaked industry knowledge suggests VTuber contracts heavily favor agencies. Talents often give up rights to their avatars and have little recourse if they quit. This has drawn parallels to older idol industries, and fans worry over abuse of power. Demands for standardized talent protections and fairer contracts have grown louder in the wake of major graduations.Management and Culture Clashes: Some controversies seem to arise from friction between Japanese corporations and overseas talents. Both Hololive and Nijisanji have noted ‚Äúcultural differences between Japanese and non-Japanese work environments‚Äù as an issue (hololivetoday.com). Non-Japanese VTubers (especially in EN divisions) have at times felt unsupported or misunderstood by management. The NiJi EN division in particular collapsed largely amidst mismanagement allegations. Many English-speaking talents have left NiJi EN in the past year for new careers or indies (Zaion Lanza, Pomu, in addition to Selen). Fans interpret this exodus as evidence that ANYCOLOR lost the trust of its foreign talent.Heavy-Handed Fandom Policing: Cover Corp‚Äôs recent legal crackdown on fan posts (filing disclosure requests to unmask anonymous posters, as reported by their PR) (cover-corp.com) upset many community members. While intended to protect VTubers from harassment, critics saw it as bullying the community. ANYCOLOR likewise has been harsh on social media, one-finding and suspending fans for criticism. These actions, combined with perceived secrecy, have made supporters feel unwelcome. In effect, agencies seem more focused on controlling criticism than addressing the root causes of discontent.In sum, there‚Äôs a growing narrative that agencies have mismanaged or exploited their talents. The repeated emergence of similar issues ‚Äì sudden graduations, legal threats, and cultural clashes ‚Äì has convinced many fans that agency systems are fragile and not always in the talent‚Äôs best interest (polygon.com) (investing.com).Permanent Shift or Passing Phase?Is the rise of indie VTubing just a temporary reaction or a lasting industry realignment? The evidence points to a possible , but also to caution: A fundamental change is that fans now visibly assert loyalty to individuals over companies (hololivetoday.com). This ideological shift is likely enduring: once viewers recognize a person behind the avatar, they tend to follow that person wherever they go. Agencies used to cultivate brand loyalty (hololive vs. nijisanji, etc.), but the exodus of stars is fracturing that pattern. Companies may need to adapt by treating talent as more than disposable IP.Indie Viability and Precedent: The success stories above show that indie careers can rival corporate ones. When enough data points (like Dokibird, Nimi, Maid Mint, Sameko) demonstrate profitability and reach for indies, more talents and fans will believe it. This could lead to a reinforcing loop: the more big names prove they can go solo, the more other talents will consider it, potentially shrinking the agency pool. Faced with talent flight, agencies might respond by reforming. There are signs Cover and ANYCOLOR are experimenting with more flexible arrangements. For instance, Cover has allowed some graduated talents to get an ‚ÄúAffiliate‚Äù status, as a way to keep them engaged. ANYCOLOR promised changes for NiJi EN after Selen‚Äôs exit (though details remain scarce). If agencies can offer slightly better terms ‚Äì more freedom, better communication ‚Äì they might stabilize. But if profits decline because top earners leave, they‚Äôll have to make real changes. The VTuber boom may be entering a mature phase. Niche communities are fracturing, new platforms (like VR or Kick streams) are emerging, and competition is heating up. Markets often oscillate: after rapid expansion comes consolidation or correction. We may see smaller agencies fold (like ‚Äúproduction kawaii‚Äù or ‚Äúidol‚Äù) and the large ones refocus, or new models (like affiliation status) arise. However, unlike a flash-in-the-pan trend, VTubing has shown staying power across multiple years and geographies (see rise of Nijisanji China, India, etc.).Global and Technological Factors: Finally, VTubing is riding larger tech waves ‚Äì from more accessible AR/VR setups to AI-generated avatars. These trends favor more indie creators (easy avatar creation, generative tools) and could fuel sustained growth. Corporate VTubers may then face competition not only from human indies but also from AI-driven avatars., while the recent surge in indie VTubing owes much to current controversies, it taps into deeper shifts: fan loyalty to personalities and wider tech democratization. It‚Äôs likely not just a short-lived rebellion. However, agencies still have powerful infrastructure, and new talents will continue to emerge through both models. The future VTuber industry may be more mixed than ever ‚Äì a blend of polished corporate acts and scrappy independents, each learning from the other. If agencies can regain trust (perhaps by improving talent contracts and transparency), they may coexist with a vibrant indie scene. If not, we could see a  where the most famous VTubers are largely self-managed, with agencies playing a supporting or niche role.]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
